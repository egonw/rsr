title: "how to get your sysrev token"
---

rsr commands require a user token. To get access to your token:

1. login to sysrev.com
2. go to your user page (click icon in upper right)
3. go to settings
4. Copy the value following "API Key"

Once you have this token you should save it to the `SYSREV_TOKEN` environmental variable:

```
Sys.setenv(SYSREV_TOKEN='enter your value')
```

You can also set the SYSREV_TOKEN environmental variable outside of your code. 

Please remember to **never share your token** and don't put your token anywhere in code that you share.  

To check that your token is working, try the below code:

```{r}
rsr::get_answers(3144)
```
