C.; Spolding, B.; Kidnapillai, S.; Connor, T.; Truong, T. T. T.; Liu, Z. S. J.; Panizzutti, B.; Richardson, M. F.; Gray, L.; Berk, M.; Dean, O. M.; Walder, K.","Although neurogenesis is affected in several psychiatric diseases, the effects and mechanisms of action of psychoactive drugs on neurogenesis remain unknown and/or controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effects of psychoactive drugs on the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis. Neuronal-like cells (NT2-N) were treated with amisulpride (10 microM), aripiprazole (0.1 microM), clozapine (10 microM), lamotrigine (50 microM), lithium (2.5 mM), quetiapine (50 microM), risperidone (0.1 microM), or valproate (0.5 mM) for 24 h. Genome wide mRNA expression was quantified and analysed using gene set enrichment analysis, with the neurogenesis gene set retrieved from the Gene Ontology database and the Mammalian Adult Neurogenesis Gene Ontology (MANGO) database. Transcription factors that are more likely to regulate these genes were investigated to better understand the biological processes driving neurogenesis. Targeted metabolomics were performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Six of the eight drugs decreased the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis in both databases. This suggests that acute treatment with these psychoactive drugs negatively regulates the expression of genes involved in neurogenesis in vitro. SOX2 and three of its target genes (CCND1, BMP4, and DKK1) were also decreased after treatment with quetiapine. This can, at least in part, explain the mechanisms by which these drugs decrease neurogenesis at a transcriptional level in vitro. These results were supported by the finding of increased metabolite markers of mature neurons following treatment with most of the drugs tested, suggesting increased proportions of mature relative to immature neurons consistent with reduced neurogenesis.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

J.","Increasing evidence from animal and human studies indicate that exposure to nicotine during development, separated from the effects of smoking tobacco, can contribute to dysregulation of brain development including behavioral deficits. An RNAseq study of human fetal cerebral cortex demonstrated that 9 out of 16 genes for human nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor subunits are selectively expressed between 7.5 and 12 post-conceptional weeks (PCW). The most highly expressed subunit genes were CHNRA4 and CHNRB2, whose protein products combine to form the most ubiquitous functional receptor isoform expressed in the adult brain. They exhibited correlated expression in both RNAseq samples, and in tissue sections by in situ hybridization. Co-localization studies with other cortical markers suggest they are pre-dominantly expressed by post-mitotic glutamatergic neuron pre-cursors in both cortical plate and pre-subplate, rather than cortical progenitor cells or GABAergic interneuron pre-cursors. However, GABAergic interneuron progenitor cells in the ganglionic eminences do express these sub-units. CHNRA5 also showed moderate levels of expression and again favored post-mitotic neurons. Other subunits, e.g., CHRNA7, exhibited low but detectable levels of expression. CHRN genes found not to be expressed included genes for subunits usually considered muscle specific, e.g., CHNRA1, although some muscle specific gene expression was detected, for instance CHNRB1. Although there is little or no synthesis of acetylcholine by intrinsic cortical neurons, cholinergic fibers from basal forebrain innervate the cerebral cortex from 12 PCW at the latest. Acetylcholine may have a paracrine effect on radially migrating cortical neurons and GABAergic interneuron progenitors.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

L.; Andersen, S.","The management of hyperthyroidism in pregnant patients has been a topic of raised clinical awareness for decades. It is a strong recommendation that overt hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease in pregnant women should be treated to prevent complications. The consequences of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy are less studied than hypothyroidism, and a literature review illustrates that the main burden of evidence to support current clinical guidance emerges from early observations of severe complications in Graves' disease patients suffering from untreated hyperthyroidism in the pregnancy. On the other hand, the more long-term consequences in children born to mothers with hyperthyroidism are less clear. A hypothesis of fetal programming by maternal hyperthyroidism implies that excessive levels of maternal thyroid hormones impair fetal growth and development. Evidence from experimental studies provides clues on such mechanisms and report adverse developmental abnormalities in the fetal brain and other organs. Only few human studies addressed developmental outcomes in children born to mothers with hyperthyroidism and did not consistently support an association. In contrast, large observational human studies performed within the last decade substantiate a risk of teratogenic side effects to the use of antithyroid drugs in early pregnancy. Thus, scientific and clinical practice are challenged by the distinct role of the various exposures associated with Graves' disease including the hyperthyroidism per se, the treatment, and thyroid autoimmunity. More basic and clinical studies are needed to extend knowledge on the effects of each exposure, on the potential interaction between exposures and with other determinants, and on the underlying mechanisms.

The genetic background of the offspring and its interaction with other prenatal and post-natal environmental cues are likely also of importance. In the present report, key findings about the possible effects of low and moderate doses of maternal alcohol intake on the neuropsychological development of the offspring are reviewed and plausible mechanisms discussed. Special focus is put on the serotonergic system within developmental and gene-environment frameworks. The review also suggests guidelines for future studies and also summarizes some of to-be-answered questions of relevance to clinical practice. Contradictory findings and paucity of studies on the effects of exposure to low alcohol levels during foetal life for the offspring's neuropsychological development call for large prospective studies, as well as for studies including neuroimaging and multi-omics analyses to dissect the neurobiological underpinnings of alcohol exposure-related phenotypes and to identify biomarkers.

E.; Goetzl, L.","INTRODUCTION: Alterations of white matter integrity and subsequent white matter structural deficits are consistent findings in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), but knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities is incomplete. Experimental rodent models of FAS have shown dysregulation of cytokine expression leading to apoptosis of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and altered oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, but whether this is representative of human FAS pathogenesis has not been determined.
METHODS: Fetal brain tissue (12.2-21.4 weeks gestation) from subjects undergoing elective termination of pregnancy was collected according to an IRB-approved protocol. Ethanol (EtOH) exposure status was classified based on a detailed face-to-face questionnaire adapted from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prenatal Alcohol and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and Stillbirth (PASS) study. Twenty EtOH-exposed fetuses were compared with 20 gestational age matched controls. Cytokine and OPC marker mRNA expression was quantified by Real-Time Polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Patterns of protein expression of OPC markers and active Capase-3 were studied by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).
RESULTS: EtOH exposure was associated with reduced markers of cell viability, OPC differentiation, and OL maturation, while early OL differentiation markers were unchanged or increased. Expression of mRNAs for proteins specific to more mature forms of OL lineage (platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRalpha) and myelin basic protein (MBP) was lower in the EtOH group than in controls. Expression of the multifunctional growth and differentiation-promoting growth factor IGF-1, which is essential for normal development, also was reduced. Reductions were not observed for markers of early stages of OL differentiation, including Nuclear transcription factor NK-2 homeobox locus 2 (Nkx2.2). Expression of mRNAs for the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), and several proinflammatory chemokines was higher in the EtOH group compared to controls, including: Growth regulated protein alpha/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (GRO-alpha/CXCL1), Interleukin 8/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (IL8/CXCL8), Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 6/Granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (CXCL16/GCP2), epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating protein 78/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5 (ENA-78/CXCL5), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). EtOH exposure also was associated with an increase in the proportion of cells expressing markers of early stage OPCs, such as A2B5 and NG2. Finally, apoptosis (measured by caspase-3 activation) was increased substantially in the EtOH group compared to controls.
CONCLUSION: Prenatal EtOH exposure is associated with excessive OL apoptosis and/or delayed OL maturation in human fetal brain. This is accompanied by markedly dysregulated expression of several chemokines and cytokines, in a pattern predictive of increased OL cytotoxicity and reduced OL differentiation. These findings are consistent with findings in animal models of FAS.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Administration of the antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) during pregnancy is tightly associated with a high risk of neurological disorders in offspring. However, the lack of an ideal human model hinders our comprehensive understanding of the impact of VPA exposure on fetal brain development, especially in early gestation. Herein, we present the first report indicating the effects of VPA on brain development at early stages using engineered cortical organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Cortical organoids were generated on micropillar arrays in a controlled manner, recapitulating the critical features of human brain development during early gestation. With VPA exposure, cortical organoids exhibited neurodevelopmental dysfunction characterized by increased neuron progenitors, inhibited neuronal differentiation and altered forebrain regionalization. Transcriptome analysis showed new markedly altered genes (e.g., KLHL1, LHX9, and MGARP) and a large number of differential expression genes (DEGs), some of which are related to autism. In particular, comparison of transcriptome data via GSEA and correlation analysis revealed the high similarity between VPA-exposed organoids with the postmortem ASD brain and autism patient-derived organoids, implying the high risk of autism with prenatal VPA exposure, even in early gestation. These new findings facilitate a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying postnatal brain disorders (such as autism) with prenatal VPA exposure. This established cortical organoid-on-a-chip platform is valuable for probing neurodevelopmental disorders under environmental exposure and can be extended to applications in the study of diseases and drug testing.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

W.; Nead Study Group","The Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs (NEAD) Study was a prospective observational multicenter study in the USA and UK, which enrolled pregnant women with epilepsy on antiepileptic drug (AED) monotherapy from 1999 to 2004. The study aimed to determine if differential long-term neurodevelopmental effects exist across four commonly used AEDs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, and valproate). In this report, we examine fetal AED exposure effects on learning and memory functions in 221 six-year-old children (including four sets of twins) whose mothers took one of these AEDs during pregnancy. Their performance was compared with that of a national sample of normally developing six year olds from the standardization sample of the Children's Memory Scale (CMS). The major results of this study indicate that the mean performance levels of children exposed to valproate were significantly below that of the children in the normal comparison group across all seven of the CMS Indexes. With one exception, this finding held up at the subtest level as well. These findings taken together with nonsignificant verbal and nonverbal forgetting scores appear to indicate that, as a group, children exposed to valproate experienced significant difficulty in their ability to process, encode, and learn both auditory/verbal as well as visual/nonverbal material. In addition, they exhibited significant difficulty holding and manipulating information in immediate auditory working memory. However, once the information was learned and stored, the valproate-exposed children appeared to be able to retrieve the information they did learn at normal levels. Finally, the processing, working memory, and learning deficits demonstrated by the valproate-exposed children are dose-related. In contrast to valproate, the findings pertaining to the children exposed to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin in monotherapy are less clear. Therefore, further research will be required to delineate the potential risks to learning and memory functions in children exposed to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin in monotherapy during pregnancy. Additional research employing larger prospective studies will be required to confirm the long-term cognitive and behavioral risks to children of mothers who are prescribed these four AEDs during pregnancy as well as to delineate any potential risks of newer AEDs and to understand the underlying mechanisms of adverse AED effects on the immature brain.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

We measured metal levels in placenta tissue samples randomly selected from five of the seven population-based birth cohorts participating in the INMA Project, collected between 2000 and 2008. Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive and motor function was carried through the use of the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA) at the age of 4-5years. Data on placental metal levels, MSCA scores, and relevant covariates was available for 302 children.

A synergistic interactive effect was found between As and Pb with respect to the general cognitive score, whereas an antagonistic interaction was found between Mn and Hg.

United states","Davis, J.; Johnson, E.","An epidemic of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) currently exists due to dramatic increases in prenatal opioid exposure. Significant variability has been observed in the development and severity of NAS among neonates exposed to prenatal opioids. This suggests that genetic factors may be playing a significant role. This has prompted case control studies that have examined the association of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes known to be involved in opioid metabolism and addiction with length of hospitalization, need for pharmacologic treatment, and total days of opioid treatment in neonates with NAS (1). Previous studies in small cohorts have demonstrated an association with genetic variants in the OPRM1, COMT, and PNOC genes with a shorter length of hospital stay and less need for treatment in neonates exposed to opioids in utero (2, 3). We recently conducted a multisite randomized controlled trial examining the most common pharmacologic treatments in infants with NAS. If parents refused the treatment portion, they could still consent to data collection and buccal swabs for genomic analyses in infants. A total of 262 infants had adequate samples and data available. Isolated DNA was tested on the Illumina Omni Array with 2.5 million SNPs involving addiction, psychiatric diseases, opioid metabolism. Once we filtered out markers defying Hardy Weinberg equilibrium or those unable to be precisely mapped, 1.3 million markers remained for testing. While 24,000 SNPs met genome‐wide significance at p\0.05 with false discovery rates of 5%, 29 SNPs met significance using 1%, and 9 SNPs met significance using a cutoff of 5 9 10‐5. While analysis of individual SNPs was important, a focus on biologic plausibility through pathway analysis was considered to be more robust. KEGG and PANTHER pathway analyses found genes involved with drug detoxification, inflammation, and antioxidant capacity to be associated with the development and severity of NAS. Genes associated with GABAnergic synapses, morphine and nicotine addiction, endocannabinoid signaling, opioid proenkephalin pathways, enkephalin release, and histamine signaling and release were also found to have important associations. Preliminary data indicate that genetic factors are associated with NAS. However, larger scale trials with a nationwide biobank will be needed to establish more definitive associations in order to implement a more targeted and Precision Medicine approach to NAS.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

I.; Chater-Diehl, E.; Singh, S. M.","Neurodevelopment in humans is a long, elaborate, and highly coordinated process involving three trimesters of prenatal development followed by decades of postnatal development and maturation. Throughout this period, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to the external environment, which may provide a range of inputs leading to positive or negative outcomes. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) result from prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). Although the molecular mechanisms of FASD are not fully characterized, they involve alterations to the regulation of gene expression via epigenetic marks. As in the prenatal stages, the postnatal period of neurodevelopment is also sensitive to environmental inputs. Often this sensitivity is reflected in children facing adverse conditions, such as maternal separation. This exposure to early life stress (ELS) is implicated in the manifestation of various behavioral abnormalities. Most FASD research has focused exclusively on the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure in isolation. Here, we review the research into the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure and ELS, with a focus on the continuum of epigenomic and transcriptomic alterations. Interestingly, a select few experiments have assessed the cumulative effect of prenatal alcohol and postnatal maternal separation stress. Regulatory regions of different sets of genes are affected by both treatments independently, and a unique set of genes are affected by the combination of treatments. Notably, epigenetic and gene expression changes converge at the clustered protocadherin locus and oxidative stress pathway.

E.","Purpose of reviewThis article reviews the most recently published evidence that investigated anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in both animals and humans, especially as it pertains to the perinatal period.Recent findingsSeveral recent studies have focused on better understanding the complex mechanisms that underlie intravenous and volatile anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in animals. Adjuvant agents that target these pathways have been investigated for their effectiveness in attenuating the neuroapoptosis and neurocognitive deficits that result from anesthesia exposure, including dexmedetomidine, rutin, vitamin C, tumor necrosis factor , lithium, apocynin, carreic acid phenethyl ester. Five clinical studies, including one randomized control trial, provided inconsistent evidence on anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in humans.SummaryDespite a growing body of preclinical studies that have demonstrated anesthesia-induced neurotoxic effects in the developing and aging brain, their effects on the human brain remains to be determined. The performance of large-scale human studies is limited by several important factors, and noninvasive biomarkers and neuroimaging modalities should be employed to define the injury phenotypes that reflect anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity. Ultimately, the use of these modalities may provide new insights into whether the concerns of anesthetics are justified in humans.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Developmental alcohol or TD exposures act either synergistically or separately to reproduce FAS features e.g. intrauterine growth retardation and related microcephaly characterized by extensive cellular death induced by one another neurotoxicant. However molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying apoptosis in both alcohol and TD toxicities are unknown. The current review addresses mechanisms of apoptosis underlying alcohol and TD toxicities for further understanding FAS pathology. This study indicates two different mitochondria pathways regulating cellular death: The first mechanism may engage alcohol which activates the c-subunit ring of the F0-ATP synthase to form MPT pore-dependent apoptosis; following the second mechanism, TD activates CyP-D translocation from mitochondrial matrix towards the mitochondrial inner membrane to form MPT pore-dependent necrosis. These studies shed light upon molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying apoptosis and necrosis in developemental brain disorders related to alcohol and thiamine deficiency, in hopes of developing new therapeutic strategies for FAS medication.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

These tools are much faster than manual tracing and demonstrate excellent test-retest reliabilities. Reliabilities of automated segmentations relative to ""gold standard"" manual tracings have, however, been shown to vary by brain region and in different cohorts. It remains uncertain to what extent smaller brain volumes and potential changes in grey/white matter contrasts in paediatric brains impact on the performance of automated methods, and how pathology may influence performance. This study examined whether using data from automated FreeSurfer segmentation would alter our ability, compared to manual segmentation, to detect prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related volume changes in subcortical regions and the corpus callosum (CC) in pre-adolescent children. High-resolution T1-weighted images were acquired, using a sequence optimized for morphometric neuroanatomical analysis, on a Siemens 3T Allegra MRI scanner in 71 right-handed, 9- to 11-year-old children (27 fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) and partial FAS (PFAS), 25 non-syndromal heavily exposed (HE) and 19 non-exposed controls) from a high-risk community in Cape Town, South Africa. Data from timeline follow-back interviews administered to the mothers prospectively during pregnancy were used to quantify the amount of alcohol (in ounces absolute alcohol per day, AA/day) that the children had been exposed to prenatally. Volumes of corpus callosum (CC) and bilateral caudate nuclei, hippocampi and nucleus accumbens (NA) were obtained by manual tracing and automated segmentation using both FreeSurfer versions 5.1 and 6.0. Reliability across methods was assessed using intraclass correlation (ICC) estimates for consistency and absolute agreement, and Cronbach's alpha. Ability to detect regions showing PAE effects was assessed separately for each segmentation method using ANOVA and linear regression of regional volumes with AA/day. Our results support findings from other studies showing excellent reliability across methods for easy-to-segment structures, such as the CC and caudate nucleus. Volumes from FreeSurfer 6.0 were smaller than those from version 5.1 in all regions except the right caudate, for which they were similar, and right hippocampus and CC, for which they were larger. Despite poor absolute agreement between methods in the NA and hippocampus, all three segmentation methods detected dose-dependent volume reductions in regions for which reliabilities on ICC consistency across methods reached at least 0.70, namely the CC, and bilateral caudate nuclei and hippocampi. PAE-related changes in the NA for which ICC consistency did not reach this minimum were inconsistent across methods and should be interpreted with caution. This is the first study to demonstrate in a pre-adolescent cohort the ability of automated segmentation with FreeSurfer to detect regional volume changes associated with pathology similar to those found using manual tracing.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

We examined whether associations between prenatal bisphenol A (BPA) or polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) exposures persist or resolve as children age. Methods: We followed 346 mother-child pairs (enrolled 2003-2006) from Cincinnati, OH from pregnancy until children were 8 years old. We measured BPA in urine collected at 16 and 26 weeks gestation and PBDE-47 in serum collected at 16 weeks gestation. We administered repeated measures of children's behavior, mental/psychomotor development, and IQ from ages 1-8 years. We determined if associations of BPA or PBDE-47 with child neurobehavior persisted or resolved as children aged using linear mixed models and estimated neurobehavioral measure reproducibility using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: Higher BPA in girls and higher PBDE-47 in both boys and girls were associated with more externalizing behaviors; these associations persisted from ages 2-8 years (exposure x age interaction p-values >= 0.36). Higher PBDE-47 concentrations were associated with decreases in MDI from ages 1-3 years (PBDE-47 x age interaction p-value = 0.03) and persistently lower IQ at ages 5 and 8 years (PBDE-47 x age interaction p-value = 0.56). Mental/psychomotor abilities had fair reproducibility from ages 1-3 years (ICCs similar to 0.4), cognitive abilities from ages 5 to 8 years had excellent reproducibility (ICCs = 0.7-0.8), and parent-reported behaviors from ages 2-8 years had poor to good reproducibility (ICCs = 0.38-0.59).

These conditions are often under-appreciated among physicians. The first clinical manifestations of leukodystrophies are often nonspecific and can occur in different ages from neonatal to late adulthood periods. The diagnosis is, therefore, challenging in most cases.Area covered: Herein, the authors discuss different aspects of leukodystrophies. The authors used MEDLINE, EMBASE, and GOOGLE SCHOLAR to provide an extensive update about epidemiology, classifications, pathology, clinical findings, diagnostic tools, and treatments of leukodystrophies. Comprehensive evaluation of clinical findings, brain magnetic resonance imaging, and genetic studies play the key roles in the early diagnosis of individuals with leukodystrophies. No cure is available for most heritable white matter disorders but symptomatic treatments can significantly decrease the burden of events. New genetic methods and stem cell transplantation are also under investigation to further increase the quality and duration of life in affected population.Expert opinion: The improvements in molecular diagnostic tools allow us to identify the meticulous underlying etiology of leukodystrophies and result in higher diagnostic rates, new classifications of leukodystrophies based on genetic information, and replacement of symptomatic managements with more specific targeted therapies.Abbreviations: 4H: Hypomyelination, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hypodontia; AAV: Adeno-associated virus; AD: autosomal dominant; AGS: Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome; ALSP: Axonal spheroids and pigmented glia; APGBD: Adult polyglucosan body disease; AR: autosomal recessive; ASO: Antisense oligonucleotide therapy; AxD: Alexander disease; BAEP: Brainstem auditory evoked potentials; CAA: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CADASIL: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CARASAL: Cathepsin A-related arteriopathy with strokes and leukoencephalopathy; CARASIL: Cerebral autosomal recessive arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CGH: Comparative genomic hybridization; ClC2: Chloride Ion Channel 2; CMTX: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, X-linked; CMV: Cytomegalovirus; CNS: central nervous system; CRISP/Cas9: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9; gRNA: Guide RNA; CTX: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; DSB: Double strand breaks; DTI: Diffusion tensor imaging; FLAIR: Fluid attenuated inversion recovery; GAN: Giant axonal neuropathy; H-ABC: Hypomyelination with atrophy of basal ganglia and cerebellum; HBSL: Hypomyelination with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and leg spasticity; HCC: Hypomyelination with congenital cataracts; HEMS: Hypomyelination of early myelinated structures; HMG CoA: Hydroxy methylglutaryl CoA; HSCT: Hematopoietic stem cell transplant; iPSC: Induced pluripotent stem cells; KSS: Kearns-Sayre syndrome; L-2-HGA: L-2-hydroxy glutaric aciduria; LBSL: Leukoencephalopathy with brainstem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate; LCC: Leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts; LTBL: Leukoencephalopathy with thalamus and brainstem involvement and high lactate; MELAS: Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke; MERRF: Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; MLC: Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts; MLD: metachromatic leukodystrophy; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; NCL: Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; NGS: Next generation sequencing; ODDD: Oculodentodigital dysplasia; PCWH: Peripheral demyelinating neuropathy-central-dysmyelinating leukodystrophy-Waardenburg syndrome-Hirschprung disease; PMD: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease; PMDL: Pelizaeus-Merzbacher-like disease; RNA: Ribonucleic acid; TW: T-weighted; VWM: Vanishing white matter; WES: whole exome sequencing; WGS: whole genome sequencing; X-ALD: X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy; XLD: X-lin ed dominant; XLR: X-linked recessive.",,WP1,WP2,0,0

We propose that these diverse developmental stressors may utilize a common mechanism that underlies impaired cognitive function and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and mood disorders that can develop in later life as a result of developmental stressors. While these stressors are directed at critical developmental windows, their impacts are long-lasting. Immune activation is a shared pathophysiology across several different developmental stressors and may thus be a targetable treatment to mitigate the later behavioral deficits. In this review, we explore different types of prenatal and perinatal stressors and their contribution to disease risk and underlying molecular mechanisms. We highlight the impact of developmental stressors on microglia biology because of their early infiltration into the brain, their critical role in brain development and function, and their long-lived status in the brain throughout life. Furthermore, we introduce innate immune memory as a potential underlying mechanism for developmental stressors' impact on disease. Finally, we highlight the molecular and epigenetic reprogramming that is known to underlie innate immune memory and explain how similar molecular mechanisms may be at work for cells to retain a long-term perturbation after exposure to developmental stressors.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

OBJECTIVE: We assessed effects of fluoride on IQ scores across prenatal and postnatal exposure windows.
METHODS: We used repeated exposures from 596 mother-child pairs in the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals pregnancy and birth cohort. Fluoride was measured in urine (mg/L) collected from women during pregnancy and in their children between 1.9 and 4.4 years; urinary fluoride was adjusted for specific gravity. We estimated infant fluoride exposure (mg/day) using water fluoride concentration and duration of formula-feeding over the first year of life. Intelligence was assessed at 3-4 years using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-III. We used generalized estimating equations to examine the associations between fluoride exposures and IQ, adjusting for covariates. We report results based on standardized exposures given their varying units of measurement.
RESULTS: The association between fluoride and performance IQ (PIQ) significantly differed across prenatal, infancy, and childhood exposure windows collapsing across child sex (p = .001). The strongest association between fluoride and PIQ was during the prenatal window, B = -2.36, 95% CI: -3.63, -1.08; the association was also significant during infancy, B = -2.11, 95% CI: -3.45, -0.76, but weaker in childhood, B = -1.51, 95% CI: -2.90, -0.12. Within sex, the association between fluoride and PIQ significantly differed across the three exposure windows (boys: p = .01; girls: p = .01); among boys, the strongest association was during the prenatal window, B = -3.01, 95% CI: -4.60, -1.42, whereas among girls, the strongest association was during infancy, B = -2.71, 95% CI: -4.59, -0.83. Full-scale IQ estimates were weaker than PIQ estimates for every window. Fluoride was not significantly associated with Verbal IQ across any exposure window.
CONCLUSION: Associations between fluoride exposure and PIQ differed based on timing of exposure. The prenatal window may be critical for boys, whereas infancy may be a critical window for girls.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Though the biochemical events involved in MeHg-(neuro)toxicity are not yet entirely comprehended, a vast literature indicates that its pro-oxidative properties explain, at least partially, several of its neurotoxic effects. As result of its electrophilicity, MeHg interacts with (and oxidize) nucleophilic groups, such as thiols and selenols, present in proteins or low-molecular weight molecules. It is noteworthy that such interactions modify the redox state of these groups and, therefore, lead to oxidative stress and impaired function of several molecules, culminating in neurotoxicity. Among these molecules, glutathione (GSH; a major thiol antioxidant) and thiol- or selenol-containing enzymes belonging to the GSH antioxidant system represent key molecular targets involved in MeHg-neurotoxicity. In this review, we firstly present a general overview concerning the neurotoxicity of MeHg. Then, we present fundamental aspects of the GSH-antioxidant system, as well as the effects of MeHg on this system.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

Endocrinol.,"Donald, K. A.; Wedderburn, C. J.; Barnett, W.; Hoffmann, N.; Zar, H. J.; Redei, E. E.; Stein, D. J.","Introduction: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) have an estimated global prevalence of 2-5% of births, but prevalence is reported to be as high as 15.5% for FASD in certain high-risk communities in South Africa. Preclinical studies demonstrate that alcohol consumption during pregnancy interferes with thyroid hormone availability and function and negatively impacts exposed offspring. Very little is currently reported on this phenomenon in humans. Methods: This pilot study was embedded in the Drakenstein Child Health Study, a multi-disciplinary longitudinal birth cohort study investigating the early biological and psychosocial determinants of child health in South Africa. Twenty one mothers and their children with moderate-severe prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) and 19 mothers and their children with no alcohol exposure were investigated. Maternal exposure history and blood samples were collected in mid-pregnancy and analyzed for serum-free thyroxin (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Children were assessed with formally measured growth parameters and development was evaluated using the Bayley III Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID Ill) at 6 and 24 months of age. Results: While there were no significant differences in serum TSH and FT4 between groups, FT3 levels were significantly higher in mothers with moderate-severe prenatal alcohol use. In abstinent pregnant women, levels of FT4 were significantly correlated with infants' scores on cognitive measures at 6 and 24 months of age and with levels of gross motor skills at 24 months. However, in mothers with alcohol use, FT4 levels were not correlated with any cognitive or motor skills, but FT3 levels were significantly associated with scores on children's social-emotional development at 24 months of age. Discussion: Thyroid function in PAE is sufficiently disrupted to lead to alterations in serum FT3 levels. The contrast in findings between PAE and abstinent dyads in their association of maternal thyroid function and infant development further suggests that such disruption is present and may contribute to adverse neurodevelopment. Further work is needed to determine the relationship between peripheral thyroid indices during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the context of PAE.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

The negative effects of the gestational alcohol use have been well documented and known for some time. However, also the subtle role of alcohol consumption by fathers prior to mating is drawing special attention.
OBJECTIVE: Both paternal and maternal alcohol exposure has been shown to affect the neurotrophins' signalling pathways in the brain and in target organs of ethanol intoxication. Neurotrophins, in particular nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are molecules playing a pivotal role in the survival, development and function of the peripheral and central nervous systems but also in the pathogenesis of developmental defects caused by alcohol exposure.
METHODS: New researches from the available literature and experimental data from our laboratory are presented in this review to offer the most recent findings regarding the effects of maternal and paternal prenatal ethanol exposure especially on the neurotrophins' signalling pathways.
RESULTS: NGF and BDNF changes play a subtle role in short- and long-lasting effects of alcohol in ethanol target tissues, including neuronal cell death and severe cognitive and physiological deficits in the newborns.
CONCLUSION: The review suggests a possible therapeutic intervention based on the use of specific molecules with antioxidant properties in order to induce a potential prevention of the harmful effects of the paternal and/or maternal alcohol exposure.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

D.; Weinberg, J.; and the, Cifasd","BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that cytokine imbalances may be at the root of deficits that occur in numerous neurodevelopmental disorders, including schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Notably, while clinical studies have demonstrated maternal cytokine imbalances with alcohol consumption during pregnancy-and data from animal models have identified immune disturbances in alcohol-exposed offspring-to date, immune alterations in alcohol-exposed children have not been explored. Thus, here we hypothesized that perturbations in the immune environment as a result of prenatal alcohol exposure will program the developing immune system, and result in immune dysfunction into childhood. Due to the important role of cytokines in brain development/function, we further hypothesized that child immune profiles might be associated with their neurodevelopmental status.
METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study in Ukraine, children of mothers reporting low/no alcohol consumption or moderate-to-heavy alcohol consumption during pregnancy were enrolled in the study and received neurodevelopmental assessments. Group stratification was based on maternal alcohol consumption and child neurodevelopmental status resulting in the following groups: A/TD, alcohol-consuming mother, typically developing child; A/ND, alcohol-consuming mother, neurodevelopmental delay in the child; C/TD, control mother (low/no alcohol consumption), typically development child; and C/ND, control mother, neurodevelopmental delay in the child. Forty cytokines/chemokines were measured in plasma and data were analyzed using regression and constrained principle component analysis.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed differential cytokine network activity associated with both prenatal alcohol exposure and neurodevelopmental status. Specifically, alcohol-exposed children showed activation of a cytokine network including eotaxin-3, eotaxin, and bFGF, irrespective of neurodevelopmental status. However, another cytokine network was differentially activated based on neurodevelopmental outcome: A/TD showed activation of MIP-1beta, MDC, and MCP-4, and inhibition of CRP and PlGF, with opposing pattern of activation/inhibition detected in the A/ND group. By contrast, in the absence of alcohol-exposure, activation of a network including IL-2, TNF-beta, IL-10, and IL-15 was associated with neurodevelopmental delay.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, this comprehensive assessment of immune markers allowed for the identification of unique immune milieus that are associated with alcohol exposure as well as both alcohol-related and alcohol-independent neurodevelopmental delay. These findings are a critical step towards establishing unique immune biomarkers for alcohol-related and alcohol-independent neurodevelopmental delay.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

A.; Vajda, F.; Reutens, D. C.; Wood, A. G.","OBJECTIVE: Prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and in particular valproate (VPA) has been shown to impair intellectual and language development in children, but the impact on memory functioning has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate memory skills in school-age children who were exposed to AEDs prenatally.
METHOD: The sample comprised of 105 children aged 6 to 8 years. Information on AED exposure, maternal epilepsy, pregnancy, and medical history was prospectively obtained. Children completed a neuropsychological assessment including measures of verbal and nonverbal memory.
RESULTS: Children exposed to VPA performed lower than expected on list learning, story recall, and figure recall tasks. Those exposed to VPA in a polytherapy regime achieved poorer verbal memory scores compared with other drug exposure groups. VPA dose was negatively correlated with both verbal and nonverbal memory measures. Language ability predicted performance on all verbal memory measures and VPA dose was an additional predictor of retroactive interference on the list learning task. Performance on figure recall was predicted by exposure to VPA in polytherapy. Children exposed to carbamazepine (CBZ) also showed a higher rate of impairment on nonverbal memory measures.
CONCLUSION: Both verbal and nonverbal memory skills are at risk in children exposed prenatally to VPA, particularly in those exposed to higher VPA doses. There may also be a selective vulnerability of the medial temporal lobe to VPA exposure. Our data highlight the possibility that nonverbal memory may also be affected in children exposed to CBZ. These findings have significant implications for the provision of cognitive and educational strategies to children exposed to AEDs in utero.

G.","Lead (Pb) is a worldwide environmental contaminant that even at low levels influences brain development and affects neurobehavior later in life; nevertheless it is only a small fraction of the neurotoxicant (NT) exposome. Exposure to environmental Pb concurrent with other NT substances is often the norm, but their joint effects are challenging to study during early life. The aim of this review is to integrate studies of Pb-containing NT mixtures during the early life and neurodevelopment outcomes of children. The Pb-containing NT mixtures that have been most studied involve other metals (Mn, Al, Hg, Cd), metalloids (As), halogen (F), and organo-halogen pollutants. Co-occurring Pb-associated exposures during pregnancy and lactation depend on the environmental sources and the metabolism and half-life of the specific NT contaminant; but offspring neurobehavioral outcomes are also influenced by social stressors. Nevertheless, Pb-associated effects from prenatal exposure portend a continued burden on measurable neurodevelopment; they thus favor increased neurological health issues, decrements in neurobehavioral tests and reductions in the quality of life. Neurobehavioral test outcomes measured in the first 1000 days showed Pb-associated negative outcomes were frequently noticed in infants (<6 months). In older (preschool and school) children studies showed more variations in NT mixtures, children's age, and sensitivity and/or specificity of neurobehavioral tests; these variations and choice of statistical model (individual NT stressor or collective effect of mixture) may explain inconsistencies. Multiple exposures to NT mixtures in children diagnosed with 'autism spectrum disorders' (ASD) and 'attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders' (ADHD), strongly suggest a Pb-associated effect. Mixture potency (number or associated NT components and respective concentrations) and time (duration and developmental stage) of exposure often showed a measurable impact on neurodevelopment; however, net effects, reversibility and/or predictability of delays are insufficiently studied and need urgent attention. Nevertheless, neurodevelopment delays can be prevented and/or attenuated if public health policies are implemented to protect the unborn and the young child.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

The burden of neuropsychiatric and developmental impairment is high, with severity and prevalence correlated with gestational age at delivery. PTB is a major risk factor for the development of cerebral palsy, lower educational attainment and deficits in cognitive functioning, and individuals born preterm have higher rates of schizophrenia, autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Factors such as gestational age at birth, systemic inflammation, respiratory morbidity, sub-optimal nutrition, and genetic vulnerability are associated with poor outcome after preterm birth, but the mechanisms linking these factors to adverse long term outcome are poorly understood. One potential mechanism linking PTB with neurodevelopmental effects is changes in the epigenome. Epigenetic processes can be defined as those leading to altered gene expression in the absence of a change in the underlying DNA sequence and include DNA methy-lation/hydroxymethylation and histone modifications. Such epigenetic modifications may be susceptible to environmental stimuli, and changes may persist long after the stimulus has ceased, providing a mechanism to explain the long-term consequences of acute exposures in early life. Many factors such as inflammation, fluctuating oxygenation and excitotoxicity which are known factors in PTB related brain injury, have also been implicated in epigenetic dysfunction. In this review, we will discuss the potential role of epigenetic dysregulation in mediating the effects of PTB on neurodevelopmental outcome, with specific emphasis on DNA methylation and the alpha-ketoglutarate dependent dioxygenase family of enzymes.

Once in the brain all these forms are transformed to inorganic Hg (I-Hg), where it bioaccumutates and remains for long periods. Hg is a well-known neurotoxicant, with its most damaging effects reported during brain development, when cellular key events, such as cell differentiation take place. A considerable number of studies report an impairment of neuronal differentiation due to MeHg exposure, however the effects of I-Hg, an important form of Hg found in brain, have received less attention. In this study, we decided to examine the effects of I-Hg exposure (5, 10 and 20 mu M) on the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells induced by retinoic acid (RA, 10 mu M). We observed extension of neuritic processes and increased expression of neuronal markers (MAP2, tubulin-beta III, and Tau) after RA stimulation, all these effects were decreased by the co-exposure to I-Hg. Interestingly, I-Hg increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) accompanied with increased levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase I (DDHA1). Remarkably I-Hg decreased levels of nitric oxide synthase neuronal (nNOS). Moreover I-Hg reduced the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) a protein recently involved in neuronal differentiation. These data suggest that the exposure to I-Hg impairs cell differentiation, and point to new potential targets of Hg toxicity such as APP and NO signaling. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

In this chapter, we first present the early overgrowth theory of ASD. Second, we introduce valproic acid (VPA), one of the most robust and well-known environmental risk factors associated with ASD, and we summarize the rapidly growing body of animal research literature using VPA as an ASD translational model. Lastly, we will detail the mechanisms of action of VPA and its impact on functional neural systems, as well as discuss future research directions that could have a lasting impact on the field.",,WP1,0,0,0

This fMRI study compared EBC-related brain activity in 47 children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (PFAS), heavily exposed (HE) non-syndromal children, and healthy controls. All of the children had previously participated in two EBC studies conducted as part of our longitudinal study of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Although learning-related behavioral differences were seen in all groups during the scans, controls showed more conditioned responses (CR) than the alcohol-exposed groups. Despite lower conditioning levels relative to controls, the exposed groups exhibited extensive cerebellar activations. Specifically, children with FAS/PFAS showed increased activation of cerebellar lobule VI in session 2, while HE children showed increased activation in session 1. Continuous measures of prenatal alcohol use correlated with learning-related activations in cerebellum and frontal cortices. Only controls showed significant cerebellar activation-CR correlations in the deep nuclei and lateral lobule VI, suggesting that these key regions supporting EBC may be functionally disorganized in alcohol-exposed children. These findings are the first to characterize abnormalities in brain function associated with the behavioral conditioning deficits seen in children with prenatal alcohol exposure.

J.; van Wijngaarden, E.; Ruegg, J.; Broberg, K.","BACKGROUND: Methylmercury (MeHg) is present in fish and is a neurotoxicant at sufficiently high levels. One potential mechanism of MeHg toxicity early in life is epigenetic dysregulation that may affect long-term neurodevelopment. Altered DNA methylation of nervous system-related genes has been associated with adult mental health outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and DNA methylation (at the cytosine of CG dinucleotides, CpGs) in three nervous system-related genes, encoding brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), glutamate receptor subunit NR2B (GRIN2B), and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), in children who were exposed to MeHg in utero.
METHODS: We tested 406 seven-year-old Seychellois children participating in the Seychelles Child Development Study (Nutrition Cohort 2), who were prenatally exposed to MeHg from maternal fish consumption. Total mercury in maternal hair (prenatal MeHg exposure measure) collected during pregnancy was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Methylation in DNA from the children's saliva was measured by pyrosequencing. To assess associations between prenatal MeHg exposure and CpG methylation at seven years of age, we used multivariable linear regression models adjusted for covariates.
RESULTS: We identified associations with prenatal MeHg exposure for DNA methylation of one GRIN2B CpG and two NR3C1 CpGs out of 12 total CpG sites. Higher prenatal MeHg was associated with higher methylation for each CpG site. For example, NR3C1 CpG3 had an expected increase of 0.03-fold for each additional 1 ppm of prenatal MeHg (B = 0.030, 95% CI 0.001, 0.059; p = 0.047). Several CpG sites associated with MeHg are located in transcription factor binding sites and the observed methylation changes are predicted to lead to lower gene expression.
CONCLUSIONS: In a population of people who consume large amounts of fish, we showed that higher prenatal MeHg exposure was associated with differential DNA methylation at seven years of age at specific CpG sites that may influence neurodevelopment and mental health.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

We provide an overview of select literature related to FASD as a socially rooted disability with intergenerational impacts and multiple layers of stigma. These social issues are intertwined with notable experiences of adversity across the lifespan and high rates of co-occurring health concerns for individuals with FASD, all of which present unique challenges for individuals, caregivers, families, service providers, and policy makers.

J.","An estimated 60 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, half of whom are women. About one-third of women with epilepsy are of childbearing age. The childbirth rate in women with epilepsy is about 20-40% lower compared to that of the general population, which may be partly due to a lower number of these women being in relationships. Lower fertility in women with epilepsy may be linked to the disease itself, but it is mainly a result of the treatment provided. Valproate, as an antiepileptic drug inhibiting histone deacetylases, may affect the expression of genes associated with cell cycle control and cellular differentiation. Evidently, this drug is associated with the risk of malformations although other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may also trigger birth defects, however, to a lower degree. Valproate (and to a certain degree other AEDs) may induce autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The main mechanism responsible for all negative effects of prenatal exposure to valproate seems inhibition of histone deacetylases. Animal studies show a reduction in the expression of genes involved in social behavior and an increase in hippocampal cytokines. Valproate-induced oxidative stress may also contribute to neural tube defects. Interestingly, paternal exposure to this AED in mice may trigger neurodevelopmental disorders as well although a population-based cohort study does not confirm this effect. To lower the risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders, a single AED at the optimal dose and supplementation with folic acid is recommended.

We used human fetal brain-derived immortalized cells (LUHMES cells) as a human neuronal differentiation model. Cell viability, neuronal, and catecholamine markers in LUHMES cells were assessed after exposure to MeHg (0-1000nM) for 6 days (from day 2 to day 8 of neuronal differentiation).

Exp.,"Kern, J. K.; Geier, D. A.; Homme, K. G.; King, P. G.; Bjorklund, G.; Chirumbolo, S.; Geier, M. R.","The prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs), including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and emotional disturbances, has increased notably in the past few decades. To date, debate continues as to the origins of NDs. Increases in widespread exposure to and bioaccumulation of chemical neurotoxicants have paralleled the upsurge in NDs, and are suggested to be causal agents for NDs. One consistent aspect of NDs is the male preponderance. This review considers the issue of male preponderance by reviewing the gender-specific neurotoxic effects of recognized neurotoxicant chemicals to assess their possible etiology in NDs. This investigation consisted of a systematic literature review of original studies published from 1970-2016 on suspected neurotoxicants, to examine whether they have a disproportionate adverse effect based on gender. Based on that review, the neurotoxicants exhibiting consistent gender-specific effects, with exposed males being more affected (than similarly exposed females), were: lead, Thimerosal/ethylmercury, some organochlorine pesticides (e.g., dieldrin, endosulfan, and heptachlor), and air pollution. The next group identified were neurotoxicants exhibiting gender-specific neurotoxic effects, with males being somewhat (but not consistently) more affected than females: mercury vapor, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organophosphate pesticides. Finally, there was a group of studies in which the neurotoxicants exhibited apparent gender-related neurotoxic effects but failed to show whether exposed males were consistently more affected than females: inorganic mercury salts, methylmercury species, and certain endocrine disruptors (e.g., phthalates and BPA). The overall conclusion from the studies reviewed was that the brain in males is more vulnerable to many toxic exposures than it is in females. Evidence suggests that the reasons for the male brain being more vulnerable include: (1) greater glutathione availability in females; (2) greater sulfate-based detoxification capacity in females; (3) potentiating effects of co-exposure to neurotoxicants and testosterone; (4) greater neuroinflammatory response in males; (5) reduced vulnerability to oxidative stress in females; and (6) neuroprotective effects of female hormones (estrogen and progesterone), especially in the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

We investigate the hypothesis that levels of defined sets of functional proteins in FCEs can be used to detect abnormalities in fetal neuronal and glial proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Method(s): Maternal plasma was obtained between 10 and 19 weeks from women with current heavy EtOH exposure and matched controls. FCE levels of synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, synaptopodin, and neurogranin were quantified normalized to the exosome marker CD81. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with specific primers for miR-9. Result(s): FCE cargo protein levels of synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, synaptopodin, and neurogranin were all significantly reduced in pregnancies exposed to current heavy EtOH use (P <.001 for all). Both synaptophysin and neurogranin appeared to be particularly discriminatory with no overlap between exposed and control subjects. Up to tenfold inhibition (90%) in MicroRNA-9 was observed in FCEs from EtOH exposed fetuses compared with controls. Conclusion(s): Our results suggest that FCEs purified from maternal plasma may be a powerful tool to assess abnormal proliferation and differentiation of CNS stem cells as early as the late first trimester.

OBJECTIVES: Our study examines associations between prenatal manganese concentrations and placental transfer of manganese with neurodevelopment in 224 2-y-old children residing near the Tar Creek Superfund Site. METHODS: We collected maternal and cord blood at delivery, measured manganese using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and assessed neurodevelopment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-II Associations between manganese and mental (MDI) and psychomotor (PDI) development indices were estimated in multivariable models. Placental transfer, approximated by cord/maternal manganese ratio, cord/total manganese ratio (total = maternal + cord), and by joint classification according to high or low (above or below median) maternal and cord manganese, was evaluated as a predictor of neurodevelopment. RESULTS: Median levels [interquanile ranges (FOR)] of manganese in maternal and cord blood, respectively, were 24.0 (19.5-29.7) and 43.1 (33.5-52.1) mu g/L. Adjusting for lead, arsenic, and other potential confounders, an IOR increase in maternal manganese was associated with -3.0 (95% CL -5.3, -0.7) points on MDI and -2.3 (95% CI: -4.1, -0.4) points on PDI. Cord manganese concentrations were not associated with neurodevelopment scores. Cord/maternal and cord/total manganese ratios were positively associated with MDI [cord/maternal: beta = 2.6 (95% Cl: = -0.04,5.3); cord/ total: beta =22.0 (95% Cl: 3.2, 40.7)] and PDI (cord/maternal: beta = 1.7 (95%Cl: = -0.5, 3.9); cord/total: beta = 15.6 (95% Cl: 0.3, 20.9)). Compared to mother child pairs with low maternal and cord manganese, associations with neurodevelopment scores were negative for pairs with either high maternal, high cord, or high maternal and cord manganese. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal blood manganese concentrations were negatively associated with early childhood neurodevelopment scores in our study.

Sci.,"Gzielo, K.; Nikiforuk, A.","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term encompassing several neurodevelopmental disorders such as Asperger syndrome or autism. It is characterised by the occurrence of distinct deficits in social behaviour and communication and repetitive patterns of behaviour. The symptoms may be of different intensity and may vary in types. Risk factors for ASD include disturbed brain homeostasis, genetic predispositions, or inflammation during the prenatal period caused by viruses or bacteria. The number of diagnosed cases is growing, but the main cause and mechanism leading to ASD is still uncertain. Recent findings from animal models and human cases highlight the contribution of glia to the ASD pathophysiology. It is known that glia cells are not only ""gluing "" neurons together but are key players participating in different processes crucial for proper brain functioning, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, inflammation, myelination, proper glutamate processing and many others. Despite the prerequisites for the involvement of glia in the processes related to the onset of autism, there are far too little data regarding the engagement of these cells in the development of ASD.</p>",,WP1,0,0,0

N.","Prenatal alcohol exposure can impact both brain development and neurobehavioral function, including verbal learning and recall, although the relation between verbal recall and brain structure in this population has not been examined fully. We aimed to determine the structural neural correlates of verbal learning and recall in youth with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure using a region of interest (ROI) approach. As part of an ongoing multisite project, subjects (age 10-16 years) with prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n = 81) and controls (CON, n = 81) were tested using the CVLT-C and measures of cortical volume, surface area, and thickness as well as hippocampal volume were derived from MRI. Group differences in brain and memory indices were tested with ANOVA. Multiple regression analyses tested whether brain ROIs significantly predicted memory performance. The AE group had lower scores than the CON group on all CVLT-C variables (ps <= .001) and volume and surface area (ps < .025), although results varied by ROI. No group differences in cortical thickness were found. The relations between cortical structure and memory performance differed between group among some ROIs, particularly those in the frontal cortex, generally with smaller surface area and/or thinner cortex predicting better performance in CON but worse performance in AE. Cortical surface area appears to be the most sensitive index to the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, while cortical thickness appears to be the least sensitive. These findings also indicate that the neural correlates of verbal memory are altered in youth with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure compared to controls.

Indeed, studies of altered brain development associated with either genetic or environmental risks emerged and thrived. In this paper, we will review selected studies of genetic and environmental risks that have been relatively more extensively investigated-familial risks, candidate risk genes, and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on the genetic side; maternal mood disorders and prenatal drug exposures on the environmental side. Emerging studies on environment-gene interactions will also be reviewed.

R.","The World Health Organisation estimates that alcohol abuse by adults accounts for about 5% of global disease burden. Additionally, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) causes 'fetal alcohol spectrum disorder' (FASD). Depending on severity, FASD is characterised by low birth weight, small head size at birth and growth retardation. There are also facial features of narrow eyes, flat upper lip and midface and impaired fine motor skills, hearing loss, poor hand-eye coordination and cognitive impairment. World-wide, up to 10% of children may be affected by PAE. It is unclear what dose or pattern of drinking results in these damaging effects, but animal models suggest that high, acute doses of ethanol (`binge drinking') in early pregnancy can result in the facial changes of FASD, whilst sustained, lower dose intake in later pregnancy produces anxiety and depression-like symptoms and deficits of learning and memory. The mechanisms underlying the deleterious effects of PAE are also unresolved, but evidence exists of long-lasting damage due to oxidative stress, increases in inflammatory mediators and changes to the brain renin-angiotensin system. There is also evidence of epigenetic changes. There is a need to prevent or limit the potential adverse effects of ethanol on the unborn child. It is highly unlikely, however, that all sexually-active women of child-bearing age not using reliable contraception will abstain from alcohol. There is therefore a need to research methods of reducing ethanol toxicity for the unborn child and / or develop therapeutic strategies to reverse the deleterious effects of ethanol on the unborn child.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,WP4

N.; Jacobson, J. L.; Lindinger, N. M.; Dodge, N. C.; Molteno, C. D.; Meintjes, E. M.; Jacobson, S. W.","Background: Response inhibition is a distinct aspect of executive function that is frequently impaired in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We used a Go/NoGo (GNG) task in a functional MRI protocol to investigate differential activation of brain regions in the response inhibition network in children diagnosed with full or partial fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS/PFAS), compared with healthy controls. Method(s): A rapid, event-related task with 120 Go and 60 NoGo trials was used to study children aged 8 to 12 years-8 with FAS/PFAS, 17 controls. Letters were projected sequentially, with Go and NoGo trials randomly interspersed across the task. BOLD signal in the whole brain was contrasted for the correct NoGo minus correct Go trials between the FAS/PFAS and control groups. Result(s): Compared to the FAS/PFAS group, controls showed greater activation of the inferior frontal and anterior cingulate network linked to response inhibition in typically developing children. By contrast, the FAS/PFAS group showed greater BOLD response in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and other middle prefrontal regions, suggesting compensation for inefficient function of pathways that normally mediate inhibitory processing. All group differences were significant after control for potential confounding variables. None of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on activation of the regions associated with response inhibition were attributable to the effects of this exposure on IQ. Conclusion(s): This is the first FASD GNG study in which all participants in the exposed group met criteria for a diagnosis of full FAS or PFAS. Although FASD is frequently comorbid with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the pattern of brain activation seen in these disorders differs, suggesting that different neural pathways mediate response inhibition in FASD and that different interventions for FASD are, therefore, warranted.

Valproic acid has been suggested as a teratogen associated with the manifestation of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as fetal valproate syndrome and autism spectrum disorders, when taken during specific time window of pregnancy. Previous studies proposed that prenatal exposure to valproic acid induces abnormal proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells, presumably by inhibiting histone deacetylase and releasing the condensed chromatin structure. Here, we found valproic acid up-regulates the transcription of T-type calcium channels by inhibiting histone deacetylase in neural progenitor cells. The pharmacological blockade of T-type calcium channels prevented the increased proliferation of neural progenitor cells induced by valproic acid. Differentiated neural cells from neural progenitor cells treated with valproic acid displayed increased levels of calcium influx in response to potassium chloride-induced depolarization. These results suggest that prenatal exposure to valproic acid up-regulates T-type calcium channels, which may contribute to increased proliferation of neural progenitor cells by inducing an abnormal calcium response and underlie the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

Genetic disruptions of sterol biosynthesis result in intellectual and developmental disabilities. Developing neurons synthesize their own cholesterol, and disruption of this process can occur by both genetic and chemical mechanisms. Many commonly prescribed medications interfere with sterol biosynthesis, including haloperidol, aripiprazole, cariprazine, fluoxetine, trazodone and amiodarone. When used during pregnancy, these compounds might have detrimental effects on the developing brain of the offspring. In particular, inhibition of dehydrocholesterol-reductase 7 (DHCR7), the last enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway, results in accumulation of the immediate cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC). 7-DHC is highly unstable, giving rise to toxic oxysterols; this is particularly pronounced in a mouse model when both the mother and the offspring carry the Dhcr7<sup>+/-</sup> genotype. Studies of human dermal fibroblasts from individuals who carry DCHR7<sup>+/-</sup> single allele mutations suggest that the same gene*medication interaction also occurs in humans. The public health relevance of these findings is high, as DHCR7-inhibitors can be considered teratogens, and are commonly used by pregnant women. In addition, sterol biosynthesis inhibiting medications should be used with caution in individuals with mutations in sterol biosynthesis genes.

Animal and human studies have implicated fetal alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as a chief mechanism in FASD. Several studies have demonstrated fetal alcohol-related alterations in methylation and expression of imprinted genes in placental, brain, and embryonic tissue. Imprinted genes are epigenetically regulated in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, in which only the maternal or paternal allele is expressed, and the other allele is silenced. The chief functions of imprinted genes are in placental development, somatic growth, and neurobehavior-three domains characteristically affected in FASD. In this review, we summarize the growing body of literature characterizing prenatal alcohol-related alterations in imprinted gene methylation and/or expression and discuss potential mechanistic roles for these alterations in the teratogenic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Future research is needed to examine potential physiologic mechanisms by which alterations in imprinted genes disrupt development in FASD, which may, in turn, elucidate novel targets for intervention.

In earlier publications we have shown no adverse associations between maternal total blood mercury levels and child behaviour, early development or cognitive function as measured by IQ. However, for IQ the lack of adverse association was conditional upon the mother being a fish eater. In this paper we analyse further data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), this time examining whether prenatal exposure to total mercury is associated with the child's scholastic abilities in reading, spelling, phoneme awareness, mathematics and science; the number of participants with prenatal mercury and relevant test results varied from 1500 to 2200. Multiple regression was used to assess relationships between prenatal total blood mercury concentrations and 16 different test results, after taking account of a variety of potential confounders; in parallel, logistic regression was used to determine associations with the risk of the child being in the lowest 15% of each score. Analyses were repeated stratifying for fish consumption and sex of the child. There was no evidence of harm associated with the level of total mercury, provided the mother ate fish during pregnancy. This was particularly true for tests of mathematics and science. We conclude that women should be confident that eating fish in pregnancy is beneficial for their unborn child.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

S.; Stirton, H.; Basalah, D.; Davie, J. R.; Clarren, S. K.; Astley, S. J.; Del Bigio, M. R.","BACKGROUND: Based upon experimental animal studies, the neurodevelopmental abnormalities associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (PNAE)/fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have been attributed, at least in part, to epigenetic modifications. However, there are no direct analyses of human brain tissue.
METHODS: Immunohistochemical detection of global epigenetic markers was performed on temporal lobe samples of autopsied fetuses and infants with documented PNAE. They were compared to age-, sex-, and postmortem delay-matched control cases (18 pairs; 20 to 70.5 weeks postconception). Temporal lobe tissue from a macaque monkey model of PNAE was also studied (5.7 to 6 months of age). We used antibodies targeting 4 DNA cytosine, 4 histone methylation, and 6 histone acetylation modifications and assigned scores based upon the semiquantitatively graded intensity and proportion of positively labeled nuclei in the ventricular and subventricular zones, ependyma, temporal cortex, temporal white matter, dentate gyrus (DG), and CA1 pyramidal layer.
RESULTS: Temporal changes were identified for almost all marks according to the state of maturation in the human brain. In the DG (and 3 other brain regions), a statistically significant increase in H3K9ac was associated with PNAE. Statistically significant decreases were seen among 5mC, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, H4K12ac, and H4K16ac in select regions. In the macaques, H3K36me3 decreased in the DG, and the ependyma showed decreases in 5fC and H3K36me3.
CONCLUSIONS: In human brain, global intranuclear epigenetic modifications are brain region and maturation state-specific. These exploratory results support the general hypothesis that PNAE is associated with a global decrease in DNA methylation, a global decrease in histone methylation, and a global increase in histone acetylation. Although the human and monkey subjects are not directly comparable in terms of brain maturation, considering the rapid temporal changes in global epigenetic modifications during brain development, interspecies comparisons may be extremely difficult.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

M.; Jacobson, S. W.; Jacobson, J. L.; Molteno, C. D.; Meintjes, E. M.; Andrew, C. M.","Background: Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies of response inhibition in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) have used a visual Go/NoGo task to study the impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on response inhibition. No studies exist using auditory versions of the task; thus, it is unclear how the deficits observed in visual tasks translate into the auditory domain. Method(s): This study examined ERPs using an auditory Go/NoGo paradigm in a sample of 35 school-age children-18 with heavy prenatal alcohol exposure and 17 normally developing controls. Result(s): Alcohol-exposed children performed as well as controls in terms of inhibiting their responses; however, their reaction times were significantly slower under the Go condition. As in the ERP visual Go/NoGo task previously administered to these children, group differences were seen in early perceptual processing, specifically related to stimulus discrimination, with a decrease in P2 amplitude in the alcohol-exposed group. The control group exhibited greater N2 amplitude in the NoGo compared to the Go condition while the alcohol-exposed group did not, suggesting a group difference in the neural substrates underlying conflict monitoring. The alcohol-exposed group demonstrated longer latency P3 with reduced amplitude, suggesting poorer allocation of attention. The alcohol-exposed group also exhibited a late positive component (LPC) similar to the one observed in the previous visual ERP study. This LPC may indicate compensatory neurophysiological function related to resetting of attentional control networks in preparation for the next trial. None of the ERP outcomes in this study were related to potential confounders which included cognitive and socioeconomic measures as well as ADHD diagnosis. Conclusion(s): The observed ERP group differences point to elements of perceptual and attentional processing likely to be involved in the performance deficits often observed in children with FASD. We also observed changes in ERPs related to conflict monitoring/response inhibition, highlighting fetal alcohol-related effects on how the brain responds when there is need to identify and respond to environmental cues by switching away from a prepotent motor response to an inhibited state.

A.","The environmental toxicant lead (Pb) has long been known to induce neurological deficits. The 1st century Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides noted that ""lead makes the mind give way"". Current studies are suggesting the effects of Pb on behaviors may involve the immune system and conversely some immunomodulatory changes may be due to Pb effects in the central nervous system. Although Pb-induced disorders do not appear to discriminate among females and males, this report discusses the differences observed in human and animal studies regarding differential gender effects on gene expression after Pb exposure. The overall ill health outcomes are apparent with variant levels of Pb exposure and exposures at different times in development. However, the consensus is that doses leading to blood lead levels>5mug/dl and prenatal exposures are most pathogenic. Although the general detriments induced by Pb may be similar in females and males, there are sex specific outcomes on health and behavior. It is suggested that Pb induces more oxidative stress in females and more upregulation of genes responding to oxidative stress, while males have more proteolytic destruction; but in both cases, there is generation of altered/denatured self-constituents causing inflammation and loss of homeostasis of neuronal and immune functions. The higher estrogen levels of females are indicated as the reason for more Pb-induced reactive oxygen species in females.

Children exposed to alcohol prenatally are at risk of developing a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) characterized by cerebral connectivity deficiency and impaired cognitive abilities. Through a comparison study of teenage subjects exposed to alcohol prenatally with healthy control subjects, we establish that the inter-hemispheric connectivity is deficient for the former, which may lead to disruption in the cortical inter-hemispheric connectivity and deficits in higher order cognitive functions as measured by an IQ test, for example.

Most articles reported these findings without consideration of how lateral asymmetries might be relevant to understanding the underlying factors leading to addiction.
OBJECTIVE: The current survey is intended to extend these observations by demonstrating hemispheric asymmetry of development due to pre-natal or adolescent/adult exposure to drugs of abuse.
METHOD: Articles that reported either pre-natal or adolescent/adult exposure to drugs of abuse were collected and the hemisphere of the affected structures was tabulated to determine if, and which, drugs affected more structures in one hemisphere or the other or both together.
RESULTS: Some drugs, notably cocaine and alcohol, differentially affected left or right hemisphere structures which significantly differed depending on whether individuals were exposed prenatally or as an adolescent/adult. Cocaine tended to affect more left hemisphere structures when exposed prenatally and significantly affected more in the right when exposed as adults. Alcohol had the reverse pattern. The difference in patterns of effect between pre-natal or adult exposure was significant for both.
CONCLUSION: The results in this survey demonstrate that some drugs of abuse appear to have a right/left differential effect on structures of the brain. Further investigation into the reasons for this asymmetry may provide new insights into underlying factors of drug-seeking and addiction.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

However, only a few studies have investigated the combined effect of PSE and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on mental and behavioral disorders among exposed adolescents and adults. This longitudinal register-based cohort study 1) compared the nature and extent of diagnosed mental and behavioral disorders among youth with PSE and matched unexposed controls, and 2) investigated the influence of PSE, health in infancy and ACEs (maternal risk factors and out-of-home care, OHC) on diagnoses of mental and behavioral disorders. The data consisted of 615 exposed youth aged 15-24 years and 1787 matched unexposed controls. Data from hospital medical records and nine registers were merged for the analysis. Descriptive analysis methods and Cox regression were used. The results showed that the prevalence of mental and behavioral disorders was twice as high among exposed compared with controls. The highest levels of mental and behavioral disorders and ACEs were found among exposed with at least one OHC episode. The difference in the risk of mental and behavioral disorders between exposed and controls diminished after controlling for the effect of ACEs. Low birth weight, maternal risk factors, and OHC were the strongest predictors of mental and behavioral disorders. The results suggest that PSE alone does not explain poorer mental health among exposed youth.

Previous studies have shown a wide range of structural and functional abnormalities in children and adolescents with PAE. The current study adds to the existing literature specifically on cortical development by examining cortical gyrification in a large sample of children with PAE compared to controls. Relationships between cortical development and intellectual functioning are also examined. Experimental design Included were 92 children with PAE and 83 controls ages 9-16 from four sites in the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD). All PAE participants had documented heavy PAE. All underwent a formal evaluation of physical anomalies and dysmorphic facial features. MRI data were collected using modified matched protocols on three platforms (Siemens, GE, and Philips). Cortical gyrification was examined using a semi-automated procedure. Principal observations Whole brain group comparisons using Monte Carlo z-simulation for multiple comparisons showed significantly lower cortical gyrification across a large proportion of the cerebral cortex amongst PAE compared to controls. Whole brain comparisons and ROI based analyses showed strong positive correlations between cortical gyrification and IQ (i.e. less developed cortex was associated with lower IQ). Conclusions Abnormalities in cortical development were seen across the brain in children with PAE compared to controls. Cortical gyrification and IQ were strongly correlated, suggesting that examining mechanisms by which alcohol disrupts cortical formation may yield clinically relevant insights and potential directions for early intervention.

Transient and mild thyroid hormone insufficiency in pregnancy is also associated with impaired neurodevelopment in the offspring (e.g., 3-4 IQ score loss in association with maternal free thyroxine in the lowest fifth percentile). While inadequate iodine intake remains the most common underlying cause of mild thyroid hormone insufficiency in vulnerable populations including pregnant women, other factors such as exposure to environmental contaminants have recently attracted increasing attention, in particular in interaction with iodine deficiency. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are natural and synthetic substances with ubiquitous exposure in children and adults including pregnant women. EDCs interfere, temporarily or permanently, with hormonal signaling pathways in the endocrine system by binding to hormone receptors and modifying gene expression. Other mechanisms involve alterations in production, metabolism, and transfer of hormones. Experimental studies have shown that exposures to EDCs affect various brain processes such as neurogenesis, neural differentiation and migration, as well as neural connectivity. Neuroimaging studies confirm brain morphological abnormalities (e.g., cortical thinning) consistent with neurodevelopmental impairments as a result of EDC exposures at standard use levels. In this review, we provide an overview of present findings from toxicological and human studies on the anti-thyroid effect of EDCs with a specific attention to fetal and early childhood exposure. This brief overview highlights the need for additional multidisciplinary studies with a focus on thyroid disruption as an underlying mechanism for developmental neurotoxicity of EDC, which can provide insight into modifiable risk factors of developmental delays in children.

Result(s): The alcohol-exposed group performed worse than controls on all domains and had a unique academic profile, supported by a significant group x academic domain interaction (p < 0.001). For the alcohol-exposed group, math reasoning was significantly lower than numerical operations, which was significantly lower than spelling and word reading. Over half of the alcohol-exposed group (58.2%) demonstrated low achievement on 1 or more academic domains. The number and percentage of children meeting criteria for low achievement varied based on the domain and definition used. The imaging analysis identified several surface area clusters that were differentially related to math (L superior parietal and R lateral/middle occipital) and spelling (bilateral inferior and medial temporal) performance by group, with no relations for the other academic domains. Generally, scores improved as surface area decreased in controls, whereas no relation or a positive relation was observed in the alcohol-exposed group. Conclusion(s): Alcohol-exposed children demonstrated deficits in academic performance across domains and definitions, with a relative weakness in math functioning. Atypical brain development may contribute to these impairments in academic achievement. Understanding academic difficulties can assist in advocating effectively for alcohol-exposed children.

K.; Zheng, L.; Williams, A.; Doucette, J. T.; Svensson, K.; Cory-Slechta, D.; Tamayo-Ortiz, M.; Torres-Calapiz, M.; Bellinger, D.; Schnaas, L.; Tellez Rojo, M. M. M.; Wright, R.","BACKGROUND: Working memory (WM) is critical for problem solving and reasoning. Beginning in infancy, children show WM capacity increasing with age but there are few validated tests of WM in very young children. Because rapid brain development may increase susceptibility to adverse impacts of prenatal neurotoxicant exposure, such as lead, tests of WM in very young children would help to delineate onset of developmental problems and windows of susceptibility.
PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess the feasibility of administering a Delayed Spatial Alternation Task (DSAT) to measure WM among 18- and 24-month old children enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal birth cohort study and compare DSAT performance with age and general cognitive development. We further explored whether prenatal lead exposure impacted DSAT performance.
METHODS: We assessed 457 mother-child pairs participating in the Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) Study in Mexico City. The DSAT and Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) were administered at 18- and 24-months. Lead was measured in maternal blood collected during pregnancy (MBPb) and in a subsample of children at 24-months (CBPb). We regressed DSAT measures on MBPb and CBPb, child sex, and maternal age, education, socioeconomic status, and household smoking. We compared DSAT performance to BSID-III performance with adjusted residuals.
RESULTS: 24-month children perform better on the DSAT than 18-month children; 24-month subjects reached a higher level on the DSAT (3.3 (0.86) vs. 2.4 (0.97), p<0.01), and had a higher number of correct responses (20.3 vs. 17.2, p<0.01). In all DSAT parameters, females performed better than males. Maternal education predicted better DSAT performance; household smoking predicted worse DSAT performance. A higher number of correct responses was associated with higher BSID-III Cognitive scales at 18 months (r=0.20, p<0.01) and 24 months (r=0.27, p<0.01). MBPb and CPBb did not significantly predict DSAT performance.
CONCLUSION: Improved performance on the DSAT with increasing age, the positive correlation with the BSID-III cognitive and language scales and the correlation with common sociodemographic predictors of neurodevelopment demonstrate the validity of the DSAT as a test of infant development.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

However, investigations in very early childhood examining immunological abnormalities such as altered neonatal cytokine/chemokine profiles in association with an aberrant developmental trajectory, are sparse. We assessed neonatal blood spots from 398 children, including 171 with ASD, which were subdivided according to severity (121 severe, 50 mild/moderate) and cognitive/adaptive levels (144 low-functioning, 27 typical to highfunctioning). The remainder were 69 children with developmental delay (DD), and 158 with typical development (TD), who served as controls in the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study. Exploratory analysis suggested that, in comparisons with TD and DD, CTACK (CCL27) and MPIF-1 (CCL23), respectively, were independently associated with ASD. Higher neonatal levels of CTACK were associated with decreased odds of ASD compared to TD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.21, 0.77), whereas higher levels of MPIF-1 were associated with increased odds of ASD (OR = 2.38, 95% Cl 1.42, 3.98) compared to DD but not to TD. MPIF-1 was positively associated with better scores in several developmental domains. Dysregulation of chemokine levels in early life can impede normal immune and neurobehavioral development, which can lead to diagnosis of ASD or DD.

V.; Dudink, J.; Groenenberg, I. A. L.; Willemsen, S. P.; Reiss, I. K. M.; Steegers-Theunissen, R. P. M.","STUDY QUESTION: Can we assess human prenatal cerebellar growth from the first until the third trimester of pregnancy and create growth trajectories to investigate associations with periconceptional maternal and fetal characteristics? SUMMARY ANSWER: Prenatal growth trajectories of the human cerebellum between 9 and 32 weeks gestational age (GA) were created using three-dimensional ultrasound (3D-US) and show negative associations with pre-pregnancy and early first trimester BMI calculated from self-reported and standardized measured weight and height, respectively. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The cerebellum is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormal cerebellar development has been associated with neurodevelopmental impairments and psychiatric diseases. Cerebellar development is particularly susceptible to exposures during the prenatal period, including maternal folate status, smoking habit and alcohol consumption. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: From 2013 until 2015, we included 182 singleton pregnancies during the first trimester as a subgroup in a prospective periconception cohort with follow-up until birth. For the statistical analyses, we selected 166 pregnancies ending in live born infants without congenital malformations. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We measured transcerebellar diameter (TCD) at 9, 11, 22, 26 and 32 weeks GA on ultrasound scans. Growth rates were calculated and growth trajectories of the cerebellum were created. Linear mixed models were used to estimate associations between cerebellar growth and maternal age, parity, mode of conception, geographic origin, prepregnancy and first trimester BMI, periconceptional smoking, alcohol consumption, timing of folic acid supplement initiation and fetal gender. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total, 166 pregnancies provided 652 (87%) ultrasound images eligible for TCD measurements. Cerebellar growth rates increased with advancing GA being 0.1691 mm/day in the first trimester, 0.2336 mm/day in the second trimester and 0.2702 mm/day in the third trimester. Pre-pregnancy BMI, calculated from self-reported body weight and height, was significantly associated with decreased cerebellar growth trajectories (beta = -0.0331 mm, 95% CI = -0.0638; -0.0024, P = 0.035). A similar association was found between cerebellar growth trajectories and first trimester BMI, calculated from standardized measurements of body weight and height (beta = -0.0325, 95% CI = -0.0642; -0.0008, P = 0.045, respectively). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: As the study population largely consisted of tertiary hospital patients, external validity should be studied in the general population. Whether small differences in prenatal cerebellar growth due to a higher pre-pregnancy and first trimester BMI have consequences for neurodevelopmental outcome needs further investigation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings further substantiate previous evidence for the detrimental impact of a higher maternal BMI on neurodevelopmental health of offspring in later life.

90171924,https://sysrev.com/p/119552/article/90171924,Toxic-induced cerebellar syndrome: from the fetal period to the elderly,Handb,"Manto, M.; Perrotta, G.","The cerebellum is a brain region which is particularly susceptible to intoxication. Clinical presentation is heterogeneous. It is often considered that elderly patients and patients presenting pre-existing structural lesions of the posterior fossa are particularly at risk of developing a toxic-induced cerebellar syndrome (TOICS). However, TOICS may occur at any age, including in utero. Indeed, the cerebellum is highly vulnerable during neurodevelopment. Amongst cerebellotoxic agents, ethanol is the most commonly implicated. The vermis is a privileged target. Ethanol exerts toxic effects upon neurons, glia (especially astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), and myelin sheaths. Prenatal alcohol exposure causes teratogenic effects on the developing cerebellum, impeding neuronal migration and differentiation. In adults, cerebellar ataxia is a major feature of both acute and chronic ethanol intoxication. Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency characterized by a triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and impaired mental status. It requires the immediate administration of high doses of thiamine by the intravenous route. The following drugs may induce a permanent cerebellar syndrome: phenytoin, lithium salts, antineoplastics, and heroin. In addition to ethanol and drugs, environmental agents are also a source of TOICS. In particular, the cerebellum is susceptible to metal intoxication. The recently described deposits of gadolinium in cerebellar nuclei in patients who had received multiple intravenous administrations are a matter of concern on a worldwide scale but we still lack the demonstration of clinically relevant effects upon motor, oculomotor, or cognitive function. Because cerebellar symptoms may be subtle or immersed in a complex encephalopathy with combined involvement of the peripheral nervous system, the diagnosis of TOICS is often overlooked. The life-threatening risk of edema of the posterior fossa with compression of the brainstem should be kept in mind, including in cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and requires posterior fossa decompression when acute hydrocephalus occurs.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

A.; van den Dries, M. A.; Korevaar, T. I. M.; Ferguson, K. K.; Peeters, R. P.; Tiemeier, H.","Background: Animal studies suggest that organophosphate (OP) pesticides exposure affects thyroid function, but evidence in humans remains sparse and inconclusive. Gestational exposure is of particular interest, since thyroid hormone is essential for fetal brain development. OP pesticides are able to cross the placental and blood-brain barrier and may interfere with fetal development processes regulated by thyroid hormone. Objective: To investigate the association of gestational OP pesticides exposure during pregnancy with maternal and cord blood thyroid hormone concentrations. Methods: This study was embedded within Generation R (Rotterdam, the Netherlands), a prospective population-based birth cohort. Mother-child pairs with OP pesticides assessment and maternal (N= 715) or cord blood (N= 482) thyroid hormone measurements were included. OP pesticides exposure was assessed at < 18, 18-25, and > 25 weeks gestation by measuring six urinary dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were measured in maternal and cord blood. Maternal measures also included total thyroxine (TT4) and TPO antibodies (TPOAbs). To study the association of creatinine-adjusted DAP metabolite concentrations with thyroid function and TPO antibodies, multivariable linear regression models including relevant confounders were used. Results: There was no association of DAP metabolites with maternal TSH, FT4, TT4 or TPOAb concentrations during pregnancy. Similarly, there was no association of DAP metabolites with cord blood TSH or FT4. Results did not change when DAP concentrations were analyzed at individual time points or as mean gestational exposure. Conclusion: Gestational OP pesticides exposure, as assessed by repeatedly measured urinary DAP metabolite concentrations in an urban population, was not associated with maternal or cord blood thyroid hormone concentrations. These findings do not support a mediating role for serum thyroid hormone availability in the relation of early life exposure to low levels of OP pesticides with child neurodevelopment. However, disruption of the thyroid system at tissue level cannot be excluded. In addition, this is one of the first studies on this subject and measurement error in DAP metabolites might have resulted in imprecise estimates. Future studies should use more urine samples to increase precision and should investigate specific OP pesticide metabolites.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

The Ages and Stages Questionnaire of China (ASQ-C) was used to assess the status of children's development and behaviour at 6months postpartum, and the levels of arsenic were determined in umbilical cord serum samples. Odds ratios for suspected developmental delay (SDD) in each domain of the ASQ-C clusters were estimated using logistic regression models.

This retrospective investigation tested for associations between reported maternal prenatal alcohol use and psychological, behavioral, and neurodevelopmental outcomes in substance-naive youths.
METHODS: Participants were 9,719 youths (ages 9.0 to 10.9 years) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Based on parental reports, 2,518 (25.9%) had been exposed to alcohol in utero. Generalized additive mixed models and multilevel cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models were used to test whether prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with psychological, behavioral, and cognitive outcomes, and whether differences in brain structure and resting-state functional connectivity partially explained these associations at baseline and 1-year follow-up, after controlling for possible confounding factors.
RESULTS: Prenatal alcohol exposure of any severity was associated with greater psychopathology, attention deficits, and impulsiveness, with some effects showing a dose-dependent response. Children with prenatal alcohol exposure, compared with those without, displayed greater cerebral and regional volume and greater regional surface area. Resting-state functional connectivity was largely unaltered in children with in utero exposure.

S.; D'Aloisio, G.; Anunziata, F.; Abate, P.; Molina, J. C.","The anatomo-physiological disruptions inherent to different categories of the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder do not encompass all the negative consequences derived from intrauterine ethanol (EtOH) exposure. Preclinical, clinical and epidemiological studies show that prenatal EtOH exposure also results in early programming of alcohol affinity. This affinity has been addressed through the examination of how EtOH prenatally exposed organisms recognize and prefer the drug's chemosensory cues and their predisposition to exhibit heightened voluntary EtOH intake during infancy and adolescence. In altricial species these processes are determined by the interaction of at least three factors during stages equivalent to the 2nd and 3rd human gestational trimester: (i) fetal processing of the drug's olfactory and gustatory attributes present in the prenatal milieu; (ii) EtOH's recruitment of central reinforcing effects that also imply progressive sensitization to the drug's motivational properties; and (iii) an associative learning process involving the prior two factors. This Pavlovian learning phenomenon is dependent upon the recruitment of the opioid system and studies also indicate a significant role of EtOH's principal metabolite (acetaldehyde, ACD) which is rapidly generated in the brain via the catalase system. The central and rapid accumulation of this metabolite represents a major factor involved in the process of fetal alcohol programming. According to recent investigations, it appears that ACD exerts early positive reinforcing consequences and antianxiety effects (negative reinforcement). Finally, this review also acknowledges human clinical and epidemiological studies indicating that moderate and binge-like drinking episodes during gestation result in neonatal recognition of EtOH's chemosensory properties coupled with a preference towards these cues. As a whole, the studies under discussion emphasize the notion that even subteratogenic EtOH exposure during fetal life seizes early functional sensory and learning capabilities that pathologically shape subsequent physiological and behavioral reactivity towards the drug.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Maternal serum arsenic levels in the first, second trimester and average arsenic exposure level during pregnancy were all inversely associated with neonatal FT4 level after adjustment for all the confounders, the adjusted beta (95% CI) were 0.19 (-0.31 to 0.07), 0.14 (-0.26 to 0.01), 0.22 (-0.42 to 0.02), respectively; and cord serum arsenic level was positively related with neonatal TSH level, the adjusted beta (95% CI) were 0.04 (0.001 to 0.08). The adverse joint toxic effect of the four metals in maternal serum in the first trimester and in cord serum on neonatal thyroid hormone parameters were also found. Conclusions: In this study, exposure to low levels of arsenic during pregnancy could directly affect neonatal thyroid hormone parameters without being mediated by maternal effect of exposure, and maternal serum arsenic levels in the first, second trimester and average arsenic exposure level during pregnancy and cord serum arsenic level may be risk factors affecting neonatal thyroid hormones. These findings indicate that neonates are more sensitive to the thyrotoxicity of arsenic exposure even at low levels. In addition, the adverse joint toxic effect of metal mixtures is also worthy of attention.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

J.; Penington, A.; Thompson, D.; Spittle, A. J.; Forster, D.; Lewis, S.; Hearps, S.; Anderson, P. J.","Purpose The Asking Questions about Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) study, established in 2011, is a prebirth cohort of 1570 mother and child pairs designed to assess the effects of low to moderate prenatal alcohol exposure and sporadic binge drinking on long-term child development. Women attending general antenatal clinics in public hospitals in Melbourne, Australia, were recruited in their first trimester, followed up three times during pregnancy and at 12 and 24 months postpartum. The current follow-up of the 6-8-year-old children aims to strengthen our understanding of the relationship between these levels of prenatal alcohol exposure and neuropsychological functioning, facial dysmorphology, brain structure and function. Participants Between June 2018 and April 2021, 802 of the 1342 eligible AQUA study families completed a parent-report questionnaire (60%). Restrictions associated with COVID-19 pandemic disrupted recruitment, but early school-age neuropsychological assessments were undertaken with 696 children (52%), and 482 (36%) craniofacial images were collected. A preplanned, exposure-representative subset of 146 children completed a brain MRI. An existing biobank was extended through collection of 427 (32%) child buccal swabs. Findings to date Over half (59%) of mothers consumed some alcohol during pregnancy, with one in five reporting at least one binge-drinking episode prior to pregnancy recognition. Children's craniofacial shape was examined at 12 months of age, and low to moderate prenatal alcohol exposure was associated with subtle midface changes. At 2 years of age, formal developmental assessments showed no evidence that cognitive, language or motor outcome was associated with any of exposure level. Future plans We will investigate the relationship between prenatal alcohol exposure and specific aspects of neurodevelopment at 6-8 years, including craniofacial shape, brain structure and function. The contribution of genetics and epigenetics to individual variation in outcomes will be examined in conjunction with national and international collaborations.

Mothers are frequently reluctant to admit alcohol consumption during pregnancy. During infancy and particularly during neonatal period, differential diagnosis is difficult. Patient concerns: This case is represented by an Italian neonate boy small for gestational age, born by caesarean section at a gestational age of 37 weeks + 6 days by neglect and single-parent pregnancy. On physical examination, he presented particular facial features: microcephaly, epicanthal folds, flat midface, low nasal bridge, indistinct philtrum, and thin upper lip; moreover, examination revealed a macro-penis and recurvation without evidence of glans. Diagnosis: Echocardiogram showed an inter-ventricular defect of medium-muscular type and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres with hypoplasia of the left cerebral hemisphere, dilatation of the left ventricle, cerebrospinal fluid cavity, and porencephaly. Interventions: We investigated the ethylglucuronide (EtG) concentration in the neonate's hair by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and we detected EtG in the infant's hair (normal value, 30 pg/mg), demonstrating prenatal alcohol exposure. Outcomes: In this neonate, EtG measure in hairs permitted the diagnosis of FASD, so allowing to exclude genetic diseases associated with similar clinical findings. After this result the mother admitted that she drunk alcohol during pregnancy (she declared 3 glasses of wine every day). At the age of 6 months, the child showed a moderate neurodevelopmental delay. Conclusion: This case shows that FAD should be considered in neonates with rare neurological diseases as porencephaly. In neonates and infants born to a mother who did not report alcohol use, EtG measure in hairs can significantly improve diagnosis of FASD, so allowing to exclude genetic diseases associated with similar clinical findings.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

R.; Curtis, K.; Zachariah, R. M.; Chudley, A. E.; Rastegar, M.","Prenatal alcohol (ethanol) exposure (PAE) is the underlying cause for a variety of birth defects and neurodevelopmental deficits referred to as ""Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD)"". The more visible phenotypes caused by PAE include growth retardation, and characteristic craniofacial abnormalities associated with functional and structural damage to the central nervous system. Ethanol is a teratogenic agent itself; but it can also alter gene expression. These changes may contribute to the spectrum of effects and different phenotypes that are dependent on alcohol metabolism, as well as the timing and duration of alcohol exposure. Evidence from both human patients and animal models show that genetic factors and epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and noncoding RNAs, contribute to the gene expression changes caused by ethanol. Not all embryos that are exposed to alcohol during development exhibit FASD symptoms after birth. FASD patients may present severe birth defects, while others are normal in physical appearance but present a variety of cognitive and behavioral difficulties. It has been hypothesized that maternal and paternal genetic factors may contribute to the sensitivity, resistance or vulnerability of the fetus to alcohol. Moreover, the epigenome is highly sensitive to a multitude of environmental insults including PAE. Studies also show 'transgenerational' effects of alcohol. In such cases, maternal or paternal preconception alcohol consumption could lead to FASD-like phenotypes in the newborn. Thus, the phenotypes in FASD can be modified by interplay between maternal/paternal genetic factors and epigenetic mechanisms. This current review summarizes the contribution of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in FASD pathobiology, and how this information could be utilized for prevention, early diagnosis and potentially treatment of the affected individuals.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

[German],Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde,"Landgraf, M. N.; Heinen, F.","Background: Intrauterine alcohol exposure can lead to toxic damage to the fetal brain and therefore to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The estimated prevalence in Germany is 1 % and FASD persists for life. Not only pediatricians and child psychiatrists but also general practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, psychotherapists and gynecologists (plus broad areas of pedagogics and social work) are confronted with FASD. Material(s) and Method(s): Based on a systematic review and methodological assessment of the literature from 2001-2015, the multidisciplinary guideline group formulated consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD. In this publication the differential diagnostic criteria for partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD) are presented. Result(s): The literature search for pFAS, ARND and ARBD resulted in 365 hits and 58 publications were included for the methodological assessment. For the diagnosis of pFAS, two out of three facial anomalies (i.e. short palpebral fissure length, thin upper lip and smooth philtrum), at least three abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) and a probable maternal alcohol consumption are required. For the diagnosis of ARND at least three abnormalities of the CNS and a confirmed intrauterine alcohol exposure are necessary. The ARBD is rejected as a separate diagnosis. Conclusion(s): Evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of FASD that are easily implemented in practice were defined. Regarding treatment and secondary prevention of complications, more research is necessary. Copyright © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Although declarative memory impairment has been documented extensively in individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), this cognitive process has been examined in only one functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, and mechanisms underlying this impairment are not well understood. We used an event-related fMRI design to examine neural activations during visual scene encoding that predict subsequent scene memory in 51 right-handed children (age range = 10-14 years, M = 11.3, SD = 1.3) whose mothers had been recruited and interviewed prospectively about their alcohol use during pregnancy. Following examination by expert dysmorphologists, children were assigned to one of three FASD diagnostic groups: FAS/PFAS (n<inf>FAS</inf> = 7; n<inf>PFAS</inf> = 4), nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE; n = 14), and Controls (n = 26). Subsequent memory was assessed in a post-scan recognition test, and subsequent memory activations were examined by contrasting activations during encoding of scenes that were subsequently remembered (hits) to those for incorrectly judged as 'new' (misses). Recognition accuracy did not differ between groups. Pooled across groups, we observed extensive bilateral subsequent memory effects in regions including the hippocampal formation, posterior parietal cortex, and occipital cortex-a pattern consistent with previous similar studies of typically developing children. Critically, in the group of children with FAS or PFAS, we observed activations in several additional regions compared to HE and Control groups. Given the absence of between-group differences in recognition accuracy, these data suggest that in achieving similar memory compared to children in the HE and Control groups, children with FAS and PFAS recruit more extensive neural resources to achieve successful memory formation.

Previous research has shown reduced brain network efficiency in older children and adolescents with PAE, but no imaging studies have examined brain differences in young children with PAE, at an age when cognitive and behavioral problems often first become apparent. The present study aimed to investigate the brain's functional connectome in young children with PAE using passive viewing fMRI. We analyzed 34 datasets from 26 children with PAE aged 2-7 years and 215 datasets from 87 unexposed typically-developing children in the same age range. The whole brain functional connectome was constructed using functional connectivity analysis across 90 regions for each dataset. We examined intra- and inter-participant stability of the functional connectome, graph theoretical measurements, and their correlations with age. Children with PAE had similar inter- and intra-participant stability to controls. However, children with PAE, but not controls, showed increasing intra-participant stability with age, suggesting a lack of variability of intrinsic brain activity over time. Inter-participant stability increased with age in controls but not in children with PAE, indicating more variability of brain function across the PAE population. Global graph metrics were similar between children with PAE and controls, in line with previous studies in older children. This study characterizes the functional connectome in young children with PAE for the first time, suggesting that the increased brain variability seen in older children develops early in childhood, when participants with PAE fail to show the expected age-related increases in inter-individual stability.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

R.","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) continue to be the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the U.S., Europe, and in endemic areas, such as the Western Cape region of South Africa. Arithmetic is highly sensitive to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE). The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) is known to play a critical role in number processing. In this study, we investigate whether smaller IPS volumes play a role in the number-processing deficits observed in children with PAE. Participants were 52 9- to 14-year-old children from a historically disadvantaged community in Cape Town, who are participating in our ongoing studies on the effects of PAE on the brain. The IPS was manually parcellated into its medial (MIPS) and lateral (LIPS) walls on magnetic resonance images. The study aimed to examine: (1) the effects of PAE on IPS regional volumes and asymmetry, (2) whether IPS regional volumes are related to number processing performance and, if so, whether these relations are moderated by PAE and (3) potential mediation by regional IPS volumes of the relation between PAE and number processing performance. Total intracranial volume (TIV) was associated with volumes in all regions except the right LIPS. Both left MIPS and left LIPS volumes were significantly smaller in children in the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)/partial FAS (PFAS) group compared to controls. The finding in the left LIPS remained significant after controlling for potential confounders and after adjustment for the smaller overall brain size of the children in the FAS/PFAS group. Smaller left LIPS volumes in the FAS/PFAS group may account for the absence of left-right asymmetry in the LIPS in children with FAS/PFAS compared to controls and nonsyndromal heavily exposed (HE) children. Bilaterally, larger MIPS volumes were associated with better WISC IQ Arithmetic scores. These effects, however, were not moderated by the degree of PAE, and regional IPS volumes did not mediate the effect of PAE on WISC Arithmetic scores. Although we found that certain regions of the IPS were smaller in children with FAS and PFAS, these PAE-induced changes in IPS volume did not mediate the alcohol-related deficits in arithmetic. © Copyright © 2021 Miles, Warton, Meintjes, Molteno, Jacobson, Jacobson and Warton.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Taking into account that the brain parenchyma is rich in gap junctions and that most pollutants inhibit their function; brain disorders might be the consequence of gap-junctional alterations due to long-term exposures to pollutants. In this article, this hypothesis is addressed through three complementary aspects: (1) the gap-junctional organization and connexin expression in brain parenchyma and their function; (2) the effect of major pollutants (pesticides, bisphenol A, phthalates, heavy metals, airborne particles, etc.) on gap-junctional and connexin functions; (3) a description of the major brain disorders categorized as neurodevelopmental (autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders, epilepsy), neurobehavioral (migraines, major depressive disorders), neurodegenerative (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases) and cancers (glioma), in which both connexin dysfunction and pollutant involvement have been described.

Med.,"Mathews, E.; Dewees, K.; Diaz, D.; Favero, C.","Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) describe a range of deficits, affecting physical, mental, cognitive, and behavioral function, arising from prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD causes widespread white matter abnormalities, with significant alterations of tracts in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus. These brain regions present with white-matter volume reductions, particularly at the midline. Neural pathways herein are guided primarily by three guidance cue families: Semaphorin/Neuropilin, Netrin/DCC, and Slit/Robo. These guidance cue/receptor pairs attract and repulse axons and ensure that they reach the proper target to make functional connections. In several cases, these signals cooperate with each other and/or additional molecular partners. Effects of alcohol on guidance cue mechanisms and their associated effectors include inhibition of growth cone response to repellant cues as well as changes in gene expression. Relevant to the corpus callosum, specifically, developmental alcohol exposure alters GABAergic and glutamatergic cell populations and glial cells that serve as guidepost cells for callosal axons. In many cases, deficits seen in FASD mirror aberrancies in guidance cue/receptor signaling.

Six core functional networks with 27 regions of interest (ROIs) were examined using seed-based and ROI-to-ROI analyses. Average seed-based connectivity maps showed significant spatial overlap of positively correlated regions for all six core networks between FASD and controls, but there was less overlap for negatively correlated regions. ROI-to-ROI matrices demonstrated lower internetwork connectivity between regions primarily associated with the salience network (anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral insula), frontal-parietal network (bilateral posterior parietal cortex), and language network (right posterior superior temporal gyrus). Post hoc correlations of the FASD participants without medication revealed a relationship between functional connectivity and performance on two cognitive tests associated with mathematics ability and attention. Even though participants with PAE exhibit very similar intranetwork functional connectivity patterns as controls, their lower internetwork functional connectivity suggests underlying deficits in the functional network brain architecture that may be related to cognitive impairment.

J.; Chang, E. T.; Loccisano, A. E.; Garry, M. R.","BACKGROUND: Neurotoxic effects of high-level occupational exposure to manganese (Mn) are well established; however, whether lower-level environmental exposure to Mn in early life causes neurodevelopmental toxicity in children is unclear.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify and evaluate epidemiologic studies of specific Mn biomarkers assessed during gestation, childhood, or adolescence in association with neurodevelopmental outcomes, focusing on quantitative exposure-response estimates with specific endpoints that were assessed in multiple independent study populations. Study quality was evaluated using the revised RTI item bank and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the overall weight of epidemiologic evidence for causality was evaluated according to the Bradford Hill considerations.
RESULTS: Twenty-two epidemiologic studies were identified that estimated associations between early-life Mn biomarkers and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Seven of these studies provided adjusted estimates for the association with child intelligence assessed using versions of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children; no other specific neurodevelopmental endpoints were assessed in more than three independent study populations each. Among the studies of child intelligence, five studies in four independent populations measured blood Mn, three studies measured hair Mn, and one measured dentin Mn. Overall, cross-sectional associations between Mn biomarkers and measures of child intelligence were mostly statistically nonsignificant but in a negative direction; however, the lone prospective cohort study found mostly null results, with some positive (favorable) associations between dentin Mn and child intelligence. Studies were methodologically limited by their cross-sectional design and potential for confounding and selection bias, as well as unaddressed questions on exposure assessment validity and biological plausibility.
CONCLUSIONS: The statistical associations reported in the few studies of specific Mn biomarkers and specific neurodevelopmental endpoints do not establish causal effects based on the Bradford Hill considerations. Additional prospective cohort studies of Mn biomarkers and validated neurodevelopmental outcomes, and a better understanding of the etiologic relevance of Mn biomarkers, are needed to shed light on whether environmental exposure to Mn causes adverse neurodevelopmental effects in children.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

N.; Beaulieu, C.","Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is linked to alterations of cerebral white matter, including volume and nonspecific diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indices of microstructure in humans. Some animal models of PAE have demonstrated myelination deficiencies, but myelin levels have not yet been evaluated in individuals with PAE. Multiecho T2 MRI offers a quantitative method to estimate myelin water fraction (MWF; related to myelin content) noninvasively, which was used here to evaluate brain myelination in children with PAE. Methods: Participants with PAE (n = 10, 6 females, mean age 13.9 years, range 7 to 18 years) and controls (n = 14, 11 females, mean age 13.2 years, range 9 to 16 years) underwent 3TMRI of the brain. T2 images (15 minutes acquisition for 32 echoes) were used to create MWF maps from which mean MWF was measured in 12 regions of interest (ROIs) including 8 in white matter and 4 in deep gray matter. Results: As expected, across the combined sample, MWF was highest for major white matter tracts such as the internal capsule and genu/splenium of the corpus callosum (10 to 18%) while the caudate and putamen hadMWF less than 5%. MeanMWF was similar across 11/12 brain white and gray matter regions for the PAE and control groups (L/R internal capsule, major forceps, putamen, caudate nucleus, L minor forceps, genu and splenium of corpus callosum). In the PAE group, MWF was positively correlated with age in the genu of corpus callosum and right minor forceps, notably 2 frontal tracts. Conclusions: Given comparableMRI-derived myelination fraction measures in PAE relative to controls, white matter alterations shown in other imaging studies, such as diffusion tensor imaging, may reflect microstructural anomalies related to axon caliber and density.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Autism,"Modabbernia, A.; Velthorst, E.; Reichenberg, A.","Background: According to recent evidence, up to 40-50% of variance in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) liability might be determined by environmental factors. In the present paper, we conducted a review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of environmental risk factors for ASD. We assessed each review for quality of evidence and provided a brief overview of putative mechanisms of environmental risk factors for ASD. Findings: Current evidence suggests that several environmental factors including vaccination, maternal smoking, thimerosal exposure, and most likely assisted reproductive technologies are unrelated to risk of ASD. On the contrary, advanced parental age is associated with higher risk of ASD. Birth complications that are associated with trauma or ischemia and hypoxia have also shown strong links to ASD, whereas other pregnancy-related factors such as maternal obesity, maternal diabetes, and caesarian section have shown a less strong (but significant) association with risk of ASD. The reviews on nutritional elements have been inconclusive about the detrimental effects of deficiency in folic acid and omega 3, but vitamin D seems to be deficient in patients with ASD. The studies on toxic elements have been largely limited by their design, but there is enough evidence for the association between some heavy metals (most important inorganic mercury and lead) and ASD that warrants further investigation. Mechanisms of the association between environmental factors and ASD are debated but might include non-causative association (including confounding), gene-related effect, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxia/ischemia, endocrine disruption, neurotransmitter alterations, and interference with signaling pathways. Conclusions: Compared to genetic studies of ASD, studies of environmental risk factors are in their infancy and have significant methodological limitations. Future studies of ASD risk factors would benefit from a developmental psychopathology approach, prospective design, precise exposure measurement, reliable timing of exposure in relation to critical developmental periods and should take into account the dynamic interplay between gene and environment by using genetically informed designs.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

This study attempted a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) classification of children with ADHD into those with PAE (ADHD+PAE) and those without (ADHD-PAE) using neurobehavioral instruments alongside magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of supraventricular brain white matter. Neurobehavioral, MRS, and DTI endpoints had been suggested by prior findings. Participants included children aged 8-13 years, 23 with ADHD+PAE, 19 with familial ADHD-PAE, and 28 typically developing (TD) controls. With area-under-the-curve (AUC) >0.90, the Conners 3 Parent Rating Scale Inattention (CIn) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (CHp) scores and the Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI) of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF2) excellently distinguished the clinical groups from TD, but not from each other (AUC < 0.70). Combinations of MRS glutamate (Glu) and N-acetyl-compounds (NAA) and DTI mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA) yielded ""good"" (AUC > 0.80) discrimination. Neuroimaging combined with CIn and BRI achieved AUC 0.72 and AUC 0.84, respectively. But neuroimaging combined with CHp yielded 14 excellent combinations with AUC >= 0.90 (all p < 0.0005), the best being Glu.AD.RD.CHp/(NAA.FA) (AUC 0.92, sensitivity 1.00, specificity 0.82, p < 0.0005). Using Cho in lieu of Glu yielded AUC 0.83.

Yet, evidence is lacking on the impact of alcohol on brain development in toddlers. This study aimed to investigate the impact of PAE on brain white matter integrity in 2-3-year-old children. Method(s): Children (n = 83, 30-37 months old) of the Drakenstein Child Health Study birth cohort, underwent diffusion MRI on a 3 T Siemens scanner during natural sleep. Parameters were extracted in children with PAE (n = 25, 56 % boys) and unexposed controls (n = 58, 62 % boys) using Tract-based Spatial Statistics, and compared by group. The contribution of maternal tobacco smoking to white matter differences was also explored. Result(s): Children with PAE had altered fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity in brain stem, limbic and association tracts compared to unexposed controls. Notably lower fractional anisotropy was found in the uncinate fasciculus, and lower mean and radial diffusivity were found in the fornix stria terminalis and corticospinal tract (FDR corrected p < 0.05). There was a significant interaction effect of PAE and prenatal tobacco exposure which lowered mean, radial and axial diffusivity in the corticospinal tract significantly in the PAE group but not controls. Conclusion(s): Widespread altered white matter microstructural integrity at 2-3 years of age is consistent with findings in neonates in the same and other cohorts, indicating persistence of effects of PAE through early life. Findings also highlight that prenatal tobacco exposure impacts the association of PAE on white matter alterations, amplifying effects in tracts underlying motor function.

R.","Recent research suggests the maternal environment may be especially important for the risk of developing autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In particular maternal infections, micronutrient deficiencies, obesity, and toxicant exposures are likely to interact with genetic risk factors to disrupt fetal brain development.
OBJECTIVES: The goal of this paper is to investigate the plausibility of maternal toxicant exposure and nutritional status as causal factors in the development of ASD.
METHODS: This paper reviews current research investigating the hypothesis that maternal toxicant exposure and prenatal micronutrient intake are important modifiable risk factors for ASD.
RESULTS: Zinc, copper, iron, and vitamin B9 are identified as specific micronutrients with relevance to the etiology of ASD. Specific toxicants induce a maternal inflammatory response leading to fetal micronutrient deficiencies that disrupt early brain development. Importantly, maternal micronutrient supplementation is associated with reduced risk of ASD. Furthermore, animal studies show that micronutrient supplementation can prevent the teratogenicity and developmental neurotoxicity of specific toxicants.
DISCUSSION: These findings lead to the hypothesis that maternal infection, obesity, and toxicant exposures (e.g. valproic acid, endocrine disrupting plasticizers, ethanol, and heavy metals) are all environmental risk factors for ASD that lead to fetal micronutrient deficiencies resulting from a maternal inflammatory response. It could be possible to use markers of inflammation and micronutrient status to identify women that would benefit from micronutrient supplementation or dietary interventions to reduce the risk of ASD. However, more research is needed to demonstrate a causal role of fetal micronutrient deficiencies and clarify the underlying mechanisms that contribute to ASD.",,0,0,0,0

New data on the BRIEF is then reported in a sample of 52 Aboriginal Canadian children with FASD for whom a primary caregiver completed the BRIEF. The children also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests. The results reveal mean scores in the impaired range for all three BRIEF index scores and seven of the eight scales, with the greatest difficulties found on the Working Memory, Inhibit and Shift scales. The majority of the children were reported as impaired on the index scores and scales, with Working Memory being most commonly impaired scale. On the performance-based tests, Trails B and Letter Fluency are most often reported as impaired, though the prevalence of impairment is greater for parent ratings than test performance. No gender difference is noted for the parent report, but the boys had slightly slower intellectual functioning and were more perseverative than the girls on testing. The presence of psychiatric comorbidity is unrelated to either BRIEF or test scores.

In both healthy MeHg-treated and N1 untreated cells, aberrations in Notch pathway activity seemed to play a critical role in promoting the differentiation toward glia. Accordingly, treatment with the established Notch inhibitor DAPT reversed the altered differentiation.

Two barriers to ingested neurotoxin transport into the central nervous system of a fetus or child are the gastrointestinal wall of the mother or child and the blood-brain barrier of the fetus or child. Inflammation from gut dysbiosis or inflammation from a disease or other agent can increase the gastrointestinal wall and the blood-brain barrier permeabilities to enable neurotoxins to reach the brain of a fetus or child. Postnatal gut dysbiosis is a particular inflammation risk for autism spectrum disorders caused by neurotoxin transport into a child's brain. An extensive gut dysbiosis or another source of inflammation such as a disease or other agent in combination with neurotoxins, including aluminum, mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, arsenic, organophosphates, and neurotoxic bacterial toxins and fungal toxins resulting from the gut dysbiosis, can elevate neurotoxin levels in a fetal or child brain to cause neurodevelopmental damage and initiate an autism spectrum disorder. The neurotoxins aluminum and mercury are especially synergistic in causing neurodevelopmental damage. There are three plausible causational pathways for autism spectrum disorders. They include inflammation and neurotoxin loading into the fetal brain during the prenatal neurodevelopment period, inflammation and neurotoxin loading into the brain during the postnatal neurodevelopment period or a two-stage loading of neurotoxins into the brain during both the prenatal and postnatal neurodevelopment periods.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

METHODS: We used data from 389 mothers and children in a prospective pregnancy and birth cohort study. We defined mean prenatal mercury concentration as the mean of total whole blood mercury concentrations in maternal samples collected at 16- and 26-weeks of gestation, delivery, and neonatal cord blood samples. We assessed parent-reported child behavior up to five times from two to 8 years of age using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). At 8 years of age, we assessed self-reported child anxiety using the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). We used multiple linear mixed models and linear regression models to estimate the association between mean prenatal mercury concentrations and child behavior and anxiety, respectively.
RESULTS: The median prenatal total blood mercury concentrations was 0.67 mug/L.

Availability of LCPUFA depends mostly on maternal fish consumption. Fish consumption also exposes the fetus to mercury which is well known neurotoxicant. We analyzed the associations of combined LCPUFA and mercury from fish consumption during pregnancy on newborn's brain measures and child neurodevelopment in a northern Adriatic coastal area.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The prospective cohort study included 257 mother - infant pairs enrolled in a susceptible population of the Public Health Impact on long-term, low-level, Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) EU Sixth Framework Programme from 2 recruitment areas of the northern part of the Adriatic coast. Umbilical cord blood taken at delivery was used for measuring concentration of total mercury (THg) and specific LCPUFA - docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA). Neonatal cranial sonography was performed at the age of 3 days in 57 newborns. Neurodevelopmental assessment of cognitive, motor and language skills were conducted at 257 children at the age of 18 months using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition. The participants were divided into two groups depending on the THg concentration in the umbilical cord blood (exposed>5.8mug/L and unexposed<5.8mug/L). Dietary habits and exposures to environmental and social factors were assessed through questionnaires.
RESULTS: There is a statistically significant difference in the cerebellum length (p=0.032) and the superior frontal gyrus width (p=0.023) between the exposed and the unexposed group. In combined analysis, including possible protective variables as DHA and ARA (R<sup>2</sup>=0.22, p=0.001), the negative contribution of THg on cerebellum length (beta=-0.16, p=0.001) persisted. We found no correlation between THg concentration in umbilical cord blood and child neurodevelopment scores at the age of 18 months. Language score with receptive and expressive subscores was significantly associated with fish consumption (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: This analysis demonstrates the existence of morphological brain changes in newborns that are prenatally exposed at mercury concentrations what was diminished in combined analyse including LCPUFA.

In most FXS patients, the FMR1 gene is epigenetically inactivated following the expansion over 200 triplets of a CGG repeat (FM: full mutation). FMR1 encodes the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), which binds several mRNAs, mainly in the brain. When the FM becomes methylated at 10-12 weeks of gestation, the FMR1 gene is transcriptionally silent. The molecular mechanisms involved in the epigenetic silencing are not fully elucidated. Among FXS families, there is a rare occurrence of males carrying a FM, which remains active because it is not methylated, thus ensuring enough FMRPs to allow for an intellectual development within normal range. Which mechanisms are responsible for sparing these individuals from being affected by FXS? In order to answer this critical question, which may have possible implications for FXS therapy, several potential epigenetic mechanisms have been described. Here, we focus on current knowledge about the role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications in FMR1 gene silencing. Copyright © 2021 by the authors.

N.; Muckle, G.; Ayotte, P.; Lanphear, B. P.; Arbuckle, T. E.; Fraser, W. D.; Bouchard, M. F.","Background: Organophosphate pesticides are widely used in agriculture and for other purposes, leading to ubiquitous exposure in human populations. Some studies reported cognitive deficits in children exposed prenatally to organophosphate pesticides, but findings from recent studies were inconsistent. Furthermore, recent biomonitoring studies suggest exposure levels have decreased. Hence, the risks from current prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides for child neurodevelopment are uncertain. Furthermore, sex-differences also remain to be better documented in relation to potential neurodevelopmental effects. Objective: To examine the association between prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides and IQ scores among boys and girls living in several major Canadian cities. Methods: We used data from the MIREC cohort (Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals). Women were recruited in 2008-2011 from 10 Canadian cities during their first trimester of pregnancy, and urine spot samples were collected for measurement of three dimethyl alkyl phosphate (DMAP) and three diethyl alkyl phosphate (DEAP) metabolites. When children were 3-4 years of age, we used the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III (WPPSI-III) to assess cognitive ability of children from 6 out of the 10 cities (Halifax, Hamilton, Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver). We analysed the association between maternal exposure to organophosphate pesticides (DMAP and DEAP urinary metabolites) and children's IQ scores with generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to take into account the clustered-data resulting from the six study sites. All analyses were sex-stratified (n = 296 boys and 311 girls). Results: The participants were predominantly well-educated, white women, with a relatively high household income. Children had a mean age of 3.4 years at the moment of IQ assessment (range, 3.0-4.1 years). In girls, there was no association between IQ scores and DEAPs or DMAPs. Higher concentrations of DEAPs were significantly associated with poorer Verbal IQ scores (for a 10-fold increase in concentrations, -6.28; 95% CIs, -12.13, -0.43) in boys. The association for Performance IQ in boys also indicated poorer scores with higher DEAP concentrations, but the confidence intervals included the null value (-4.05; 95% CIs, -10.19, 2.10). The relation between DMAPs and IQ scores in boys was also negative, but association estimates were small and not significant. Conclusion: Urinary metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were not associated with IQ in girls, but we observed that higher maternal urinary DEAPs were associated with poorer Verbal IQ in boys. However, exposure misclassification may be an issue as only one urine sample per woman was analysed. The present study contributes to the accumulating evidence linking exposure to organophosphate pesticides during fetal development with poorer cognitive function in children, bringing data on the risks in a context of low exposure levels encountered in primarily urban populations from Canada.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

K.; Hill, S. Y.","Background: Offspring with a family history of alcohol dependence (AD) have been shown to have altered structural and functional integrity of corticolimbic brain structures. Similarly, prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with a variety of structural and functional brain changes. The goal of this study was to differentiate the brain gray matter volumetric differences associated with familial risk and prenatal exposure to alcohol among offspring while controlling for lifetime personal exposures to alcohol and drugs. Method(s): A total of 52 high-risk (HR) offspring from maternal multiplex families with a high proportion of AD were studied along with 55 low-risk (LR) offspring. Voxel-based morphometric analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) software using 3T structural images from these offspring to identify gray matter volume differences associated with familial risk and prenatal exposure. Result(s): Significant familial risk group differences were seen with HR males showing reduced volume of the left inferior temporal, left fusiform, and left and right insula regions relative to LR males, controlling for prenatal exposure to alcohol drugs and cigarettes. HR females showed a reduction in the right fusiform but also showed a reduction in volume in portions of the cerebellum (left crus I and left lobe 8). Prenatal alcohol exposure effects, assessed within the familial HR group, was associated with reduced right middle cingulum and left middle temporal volume. Even low exposure resulting from mothers drinking in amounts less than the median of those who drank (53 drinks or less over the course of the pregnancy) showed a reduction in volume in the right anterior cingulum and in the left cerebellum (lobes 4 and 5).

Cell Biol.,"Shabtai, Y.; Fainsod, A.","Several models have been proposed to explain the neurodevelopmental syndrome induced by exposure of human embryos to alcohol, which is known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). One of the proposed models suggests a competition for the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of retinoic acid. The outcome of such competition is development under conditions of reduced retinoic acid signaling. Retinoic acid is one of the biologically active metabolites of vitamin A (retinol), and regulates numerous embryonic and differentiation processes. The developmental malformations characteristic of FASD resemble those observed in vitamin A deficiency syndrome as well as from inhibition of retinoic acid biosynthesis or signaling in experimental models. There is extensive biochemical and enzymatic overlap between ethanol clearance and retinoic acid biosynthesis. Several lines of evidence suggest that in the embryo, the competition takes place between acetaldehyde and retinaldehyde for the aldehyde dehydrogenase activity available. In adults, this competition also extends to the alcohol dehydrogenase activity. Ethanol-induced developmental defects can be ameliorated by increasing the levels of retinol, retinaldehyde, or retinaldehyde dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde inhibits the production of retinoic acid by retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, further supporting the competition model. All of the evidence supports the reduction of retinoic acid signaling as the etiological trigger in the induction of FASD.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between prenatal MeHg and maternal status of n-3 and n-6 PUFA with neurodevelopment, and to determine whether PUFA might modify prenatal MeHg associations with neurodevelopment.
METHODS: We examined the Seychelles Child Development Study Nutrition Cohort 2 (NC2) at age 7 y. We used a sophisticated and extensive neurodevelopmental test battery that addressed 17 specific outcomes in multiple neurodevelopmental domains: cognition, executive and psychomotor function, language development, behavior, scholastic achievement, and social communication. Analyses were undertaken on 1237 mother-child pairs with complete covariate data (after exclusions) and a measure of at least 1 outcome. We examined the main and interactive associations of prenatal MeHg exposure (measured as maternal hair mercury) and prenatal PUFA status (measured in maternal serum at 28 weeks' gestation) on child neurodevelopmental outcomes using linear regression models. We applied the Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons and considered P values <0.0029 to be statistically significant.
RESULTS: Prenatal MeHg exposure and maternal DHA and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) (AA) status were not significantly associated with any neurodevelopmental outcomes. Findings for 4 outcomes encompassing executive function, cognition, and linguistic skills suggested better performance with an increasing maternal n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio (P values ranging from 0.004 to 0.05), but none of these associations were significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. No significant interaction between MeHg exposure and PUFA status was present.

The evidence to date indicates that the developing brain is most sensitive to fluoride-induced neurotoxicity during the intrauterine period. Exposure to a low dose of fluoride later in childhood, at ages approximately 6-13 years, may or may not be associated with a reduction in IQ or school performance. Whether or not fluoride exposure in later childhood is associated with developmental neurotoxicity may reflect the degree to which later childhood exposure parallels intrauterine exposure. In stable societies with a single source of fluoride, such as the water supply, and no fluoride pollution from burning coal or other industrial sources, e.g., the villages of Wamiao and Xinhuai in rural China studied by Xiang et al., a higher correlation may be present between intrauterine and later childhood exposure than in societies where multiple fluoride sources are present such as industrial sources, foods high in fluoride, fluoridated salt, and fluoridated toothpaste, e.g., Mexico City studied by Bashash et al. and Thomas et al.

Lead exposure in early life can affect brain development with persisting influences on cognitive and behavioral functioning, as well as, elevated risks for developing a variety of diseases and disorders in later life. Although both sexes are affected by Pb exposure, the incidence, manifestation, and severity of outcomes appears to differ in males and females. Results from epidemiologic and animal studies indicate significant effect modification by sex, however, the results are not consistent across studies. Unfortunately, only a limited number of human epidemiological studies have included both sexes in independent outcome analyses limiting our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding sex-differentiated outcomes. Additionally, due to various methodological differences across studies, there is still not a good mechanistic understanding of the molecular effects of lead on the brain and the factors that influence differential responses to Pb based on sex. In this review, focused on prenatal and postnatal Pb exposures in humans and animal models, we discuss current literature supporting sex differences in outcomes in response to Pb exposure and explore some of the ideas regarding potential molecular mechanisms that may contribute to sex-related differences in outcomes from developmental Pb exposure. The sex-dependent variability in outcomes from developmental Pb exposure may arise from a combination of complex factors, including, but not limited to, intrinsic sex-specific molecular/genetic mechanisms and external risk factors including sex-specific responses to environmental stressors which may act through shared epigenetic pathways to influence the genome and behavioral output.

Over 40 JS-associated genes are known with a diagnostic yield of 60%-75%. In 2018, we reported homozygous hypomorphic missense variants of the SUFU gene in two families with mild JS. Recently, heterozygous truncating SUFU variants were identified in families with dominantly inherited COMA, occasionally associated with mild DD and subtle cerebellar anomalies.
METHODS: We reanalysed next generation sequencing (NGS) data in two cohorts comprising 1097 probands referred for genetic testing of JS genes.
RESULTS: Heterozygous truncating and splice-site SUFU variants were detected in 22 patients from 17 families (1.5%) with strong male prevalence (86%), and in 8 asymptomatic parents. Patients presented with COMA, hypotonia, ataxia and mild DD, and only a third manifested intellectual disability of variable severity. Brain MRI showed consistent findings characterised by vermis hypoplasia, superior cerebellar dysplasia and subtle-to-mild abnormalities of the superior cerebellar peduncles. The same pattern was observed in two out of three tested asymptomatic parents.
CONCLUSION: Heterozygous truncating or splice-site SUFU variants cause a novel neurodevelopmental syndrome encompassing COMA and mild JS, which likely represent overlapping entities. Variants can arise de novo or be inherited from a healthy parent, representing the first cause of JS with dominant inheritance and reduced penetrance.

Genetic factors are important in ASD causation, although environmental factors are also involved in ASD pathophysiology. Environmental factors might affect the genetic processes of brain development through the modulation of molecular pathways that might be involved with ASD. Valproic acid and Propionic acid are the major environmental factors that serve as medicine and food preservative. VPA is used as an anti-epileptic medicine, but it has adverse effects on pregnant women and alters the developmental patterns of the embryo. It is a multi-targeting agent and affects through the 5-HT, GABA, etc. PPA is a secondary metabolite of gut microbiota that is commonly used as a food preservative.

Using three-dimensional facial scans and principal component analysis, we identified a facial shape associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in autistic children. However, variations in the alcohol-related facial shape were generally not associated with behavioral and cognitive outcomes. These findings suggest that while early exposure to alcohol may influence the development of facial structures, it does not appear to be associated with ASD phenotypic variability.

V.; Solonsky, A. V.; Shumilova, S. N.; Shushpanova, O. V.; Bokhan, N. A.","Exposure to alcohol causes imbalances in neuroimmune function and impaired brain development. Alcohol activates the innate immune signaling pathways in the brain. Neuroimmune molecules expressed and secreted by glial cells of the brain (microglia, oligodendroglia) alter the function of neurons and further stimulate the development of alcoholic behavior. Various signaling pathways and brain cells are involved in the transmission of neuroimmune signals. Glial cells are the main sources of immune mediators in the brain, which respond to and release immune signals in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to study neuronal elements: morphometric parameters of glioblasts, synaptic structures and properties of synaptosomal GABAA-benzodiazepine receptors of the neuroimmune system in the embryogenesis of the human brain under perinatal exposure to alcohol. Changes in glioblasts in the brain tissue of human embryos and fetuses were revealed under conditions of chronic prenatal alcoholization with an increase in gestational age compared with control subgroups: a significant increase in the average number of glioblasts, the length of the perimeters of presynaptic terminal structures, postsynaptic density, presynaptic terminal regions were significantly less (p < 0.01) in the study group than in the control comparison group. Exposure to ethanol leads to a decrease in the affinity of GABAA-benzodiazepine receptors, which affects neuronal plasticity associated with the development and differentiation of progenitor cells (glioblasts and neuroblasts) during embryogenesis of the human brain and leads to suppression of GABAergic function in the brain. This causes a disruption in the interconnection of embryonic cells in the brain, leads to excessive apoptosis due to the activation of glial cells of the nervous tissue, disruption of neuroimmune function in the developing brain, changes in neuronal circuits, as well as a change in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory effects, which affects the functional activity in the central nervous system. Glial activation is a compensatory reaction caused by neuroplastic changes aimed at adapting the developing brain of the embryo and fetus under conditions of neurotoxicity and hypoxia under the influence of prenatal alcoholization of the maternal organism and the effect of ethanol on the fetus. The dynamics of changes in glial elements and receptor activity in the nervous tissue of human embryos and fetuses under conditions of prenatal exposure to alcohol indicates a more pronounced effect of alcohol on the earliest stages of human embryo development, which is of great practical importance in planning pregnancy and the inadmissibility of alcoholization of the mother in order to avoid negative consequences in offspring.

Therefore, the possibility of their transdifferentiation towards a neural lineage has been an aspect of active research. In the present study, MSCs were isolated from human placental tissue (P-MSC) and subjected them to neural differentiation. It was found that the P-MSCs differentiated towards neural lineage in appropriate differentiation conditions. However, when a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor - valproic acid (VPA) - was incorporated in the medium, there was a further increase in their neural differentiation potential. The increase in the number of neurites and neural lineage specific markers was notable. The VPA-treated cells showed a significantly elevated membrane potential compared with the cells grown in only differentiation medium. When the molecular mechanism was studied, the enhancement in the neuronal lineage specification was caused by the inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 2 and an increase in BMP4 under both conditions. The target of VPA (HDAC2) was reduced in the VPA set, whereas HDAC1 remained unchanged. Concurrent reduction in the levels of Stat3 was observed, leading to an upregulation of betaIII tubulin, which is a neuronal lineage-specific marker. The components of Notch signalling (i.e. decreased notch 1 and increased notch 3) also supported differentiation towards the neuronal lineage. Thus, the VPA treated P-MSCs can serve as an alternative source for deriving neural cells for use in both research and in clinics. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

Our objective was to compare language related functional MRI network connectivity (FC) of children with women with epilepsy with antenatal AED exposure (CAED) with that of healthy children (COAED) for delineating functional basis of the language dysfunction. Method(s): CAED under prospective follow up in Kerala Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy were consecutively sampled. COAED were identified from volunteers with normal brain MRI. Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals score (CELF) was used to assess language. Functional MRI done using verb generation paradigm to activate language areas and key language network nodes were identified. A multivariate ROI-to-ROI and Seed-to-Voxel based FC was done using the selected seed regions in the language areas located in the right and left hemisphere in all subjects using the CONN functional connectivity toolbox in SPM8 under MATLAB. Result(s): Strong connectivity was observed within the identified language network between all language nodes bilaterally in CAED compare to controls. The mean connectivity strength of language network (LN) on the left side in CAED was 9.63 +/- 4.62 (Mean +/- SD) while for COAED it was 6.96 +/- 3.67 (p=0.0001). The mean connectivity strength of LN between CAED (4.86 +/- 1.07) and COAED (4.32 +/-1.2) on the right hemisphere was not statistically significant (p=0.18). Conclusion(s): CAED with impaired language function had significantly increased functional connectivity which may indicate poor differentiation and localization of language centers.

Most studies of PDE effects on the brain are based on animal models. In this study, based on a large sample of 133 human neonates and leveraging a novel linear mixed-effect model designed for intersubject variability analyses, we studied the effects of six prenatally exposed drugs (i.e., nicotine, alcohol, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, marijuana, cocaine, and opioids) on neonatal whole-brain functional organization and compared them with five other critical nondrug variables (i.e., gestational age at birth/scan, sex, birth weight, and maternal depression). The behavioral implications were also examined. Magnitude-wise, through summing across individual drug effects, our results highlighted ~5% of whole-brain functional connections (FCs) affected by PDE, which was highly comparable with the combined effects of the five nond rug variables. Spatially, the detected PDE effects featured drug-specific patterns with a common bias in higher-order brain regions/networks. Regarding brain-behavioral relationships, the detected connections showing significant drug effects also demonstrated significant correlations with 3-month behavioral outcomes. Further mediation analyses supported a mediation role of the detected brain FCs between PDE status and cognitive/language outcomes.

M.; Chung, D. D.; Pinson, M. R.; Salem, N. A.; Eaves, S. E.; Miranda, R. C.","BACKGROUND: Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate most of the neurons of the adult brain in humans, during the mid-first through second-trimester period. This critical neurogenic window is particularly vulnerable to prenatal alcohol exposure, which can result in diminished brain growth. Previous studies showed that ethanol (EtOH) exposure does not kill NSCs, but, rather, results in their depletion by influencing cell cycle kinetics and promoting aberrant maturation, in part, by altering NSC expression of key neurogenic miRNAs. NSCs reside in a complex microenvironment rich in extracellular vesicles, shown to traffic miRNA cargo between cells.
METHODS: We profiled the miRNA content of extracellular vesicles from control and EtOH-exposed ex vivo neurosphere cultures of fetal NSCs. We subsequently examined the effects of one EtOH-sensitive miRNA, miR-140-3p, on NSC growth, survival, and maturation.
RESULTS: EtOH exposure significantly elevates levels of a subset of miRNAs in secreted extracellular vesicles. Overexpression of one of these elevated miRNAs, miR-140-3p, and its passenger strand relative, miR-140-5p, significantly increased the proportion of S-phase cells while decreasing the proportion of G<sub>0</sub> /G<sub>1</sub> cells compared to controls. In contrast, while miR-140-3p knockdown had minimal effects on the proportion of cells in each phase of the cell cycle, knockdown of miR-140-5p significantly decreased the proportion of cells in G<sub>2</sub> /M phase. Furthermore, miR-140-3p overexpression, during mitogen-withdrawal-induced NSC differentiation, favors astroglial maturation at the expense of neural and oligodendrocyte differentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the dysregulated miRNA content of extracellular vesicles following EtOH exposure may result in aberrant neural progenitor cell growth and maturation, explaining brain growth deficits associated with prenatal alcohol exposure.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

F.; Hyde, C.; Scheffler, A. W.; Golshani, P.; Cook, E. H.; Reiter, L. T.; Senturk, D.; Jeste, S. S.","Background: Duplications of 15q11.2-q13.1 (Dup15q syndrome) are highly penetrant for autism, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and epilepsy. The 15q region harbors genes critical for brain development, particularly UBE3A and a cluster of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) genes. We recently described an electrophysiological biomarker of the syndrome, characterized by excessive beta oscillations (12-30 Hz), resembling electroencephalogram (EEG) changes induced by allosteric modulation of GABAARs. In this follow-up study, we tested a larger cohort of children with Dup15q syndrome to comprehensively examine properties of this EEG biomarker that would inform its use in future clinical trials, specifically, its (1) relation to basic clinical features, such as age, duplication type, and epilepsy; (2) relation to behavioral characteristics, such as cognition and adaptive function; (3) stability over time; and (4) reproducibility of the signal in clinical EEG recordings. Method(s): We computed EEG power and beta peak frequency (BPF) in a cohort of children with Dup15q syndrome (N = 41, age range 9-189 months). To relate EEG parameters to clinical (study 1) and behavioral features (study 2), we examined age, duplication type, epilepsy, cognition, and daily living skills (DLS) as predictors of beta power and BPF. To evaluate stability over time (study 3), we derived the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) from beta power and BPF computed from children with multiple EEG recordings (N = 10, age range 18-161 months). To evaluate reproducibility in a clinical setting (study 4), we derived ICCs from beta power computed from children (N = 8, age range 19-96 months), who had undergone both research EEG and clinical EEG. Result(s): The most promising relationships between EEG and clinical traits were found using BPF. BPF was predicted both by epilepsy status (R 2 = 0.11, p = 0.038) and the DLS component of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (R 2 = 0.17, p = 0.01). Beta power and peak frequency showed high stability across repeated visits (beta power ICC = 0.93, BPF ICC = 0.92). A reproducibility analysis revealed that beta power estimates are comparable between research and clinical EEG (ICC = 0.94). Conclusion(s): In this era of precision health, with pharmacological and neuromodulatory therapies being developed and tested for specific genetic etiologies of neurodevelopmental disorders, quantification and examination of mechanistic biomarkers can greatly improve clinical trials. To this end, the robust beta oscillations evident in Dup15q syndrome are clinically reproducible and stable over time. With future preclinical and computational studies that will help disentangle the underlying mechanism, it is possible that this biomarker could serve as a robust measure of drug target engagement or a proximal outcome measure in future disease modifying intervention trials.

This article describes the role of genetic testing using whole-exome sequencing (WES) in detecting rare AS variants, a point mutation in the UBE3A gene. Case presentation: We describe a rarely reported clinical presentation of AS in a two year and ten months old girl with severe developmental delay, movement and balance disorder, frequent smiling, apparent happy demeanor, speech impairment, absence of seizure, lack of sleep, and abnormal food-related behavior. Physical examination showed microcephaly, with facial characteristics of AS, ataxia gait, and truncal hypotonia. The electroencephalogram showed medium amplitude rhythmic 2-3c/s. Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed microcephaly, corpus callosum dysgenesis, and heterotopia grey matter on the bilateral lateral ventricle. WES was conducted to search pathogenic variants and showed a heterozygous mutation in exon 9 of the UBE3A gene, c.1513C > T (p.Arg505Ter). Conclusion(s): Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has several underlying genetic etiologies. WES could detect a rare variant of Angelman syndrome, identified as the point mutation of the UBE3A gene, which cannot be seen with other modalities. Copyright © 2021",,WP1,WP2,0,0

K.; Richardson, J. R.; Hart, R. P.","Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is the evolutionary counterpart to acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Both are expressed early in nervous system development prior to cholinergic synapse formation. The organophosphate pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) primarily exerts toxicity through the inhibition of AChE, which results in excess cholinergic stimulation at the synapse. We hypothesized that the inhibition of AChE and BChE by CPF may impair early neurogenesis in neural stem cells (NSCs). To model neurodevelopment in vitro, we used human NSCs derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a focus on the initial differentiation mechanisms. Over the six days of NSC differentiation, the BChE activity and mRNA expression significantly increased, while the AChE activity and expression remained unchanged. The CPF treatment (10 M) caused 82% and 92% inhibition of AChE and BChE, respectively. The CPF exposure had no effect on the cell viability or the expression of the differentiation markers HES5, DCX, or MAP2. However, the shRNA-knockdown of the BChE expression resulted in the decreased or delayed expression of the transcription factors HES5 and HES3. BChE may have a role in the differentiation of NSCs independent of, or in addition to, its enzymatic activity.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

M.; Flynn, L.; Kabella, D.; Schendel, M.; Cano, S.; Savage, D. D.; Rayburn, W.; Leeman, L. M.; Lowe, J.; Bakhireva, L. N.","Early identification of children who experience developmental delays due to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) remains a challenge for individuals who do not exhibit facial dysmorphia. It is well-established that children with PAE may still exhibit the cognitive and behavioral difficulties, and individuals without facial dysmorphia make up the majority of individuals affected by PAE. This study employed a prospective cohort design to capture alcohol consumption patterns during pregnancy and then followed the infants to 6 months of age. Infants were assessed using magnetoencephalography to capture neurophysiological indicators of brain development and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III to measure behavioral development. To account for socioeconomic and family environmental factors, we employed a two-by-two design with pregnant women who were or were not using opioid maintenance therapy (OMT) and did or did not consume alcohol during pregnancy. Based on prior studies, we hypothesized that infants with PAE would exhibit broad increased spectral amplitude relative to non-PAE infants. We also hypothesized that the developmental shift from low to high frequency spectral amplitude would be delayed in infants with PAE relative to controls. Our results demonstrated broadband increased spectral amplitude, interpreted as hypersynchrony, in PAE infants with no significant interaction with OMT. Unlike prior EEG studies in neonates, our results indicate that this hypersynchrony was highly lateralized to left hemisphere and primarily focused in temporal/lateral frontal regions. Furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between estimated number of drinks consumed during pregnancy and spectral amplitude revealing a dose-response effect of increased hypersynchrony corresponding to greater alcohol consumption. Contrary to our second hypothesis, we did not see a significant group difference in the contribution of low frequency to high frequency amplitude at 6 months of age. These results provide new evidence that hypersynchrony, previously observed in neonates prenatally exposed to high levels of alcohol, persists until 6 months of age and this measure is detectable with low to moderate exposure of alcohol with a dose-response effect. These results indicate that hypersynchrony may provide a sensitive early marker of prenatal alcohol exposure in infants up to 6 months of age. Copyright © 2017 The Authors",,0,WP2,WP3,0

S.; Hong, Y. C.; Park, H.; Ha, M.; Kim, Y.; Ha, E. H.","Background: Exposure to mixture of neurotoxic metals such as lead, mercury and cadmium occurs at a specific point of time. When exposed to metal mixtures, one metal may act as an agonist or antagonist to another metal. Thus, it is important to study the effects of exposure to a combination of metals on children's development using advance statistical methods. Objectives: In this study, we explored the effects of prenatal metal exposure including lead, mercury and cadmium in early pregnancy (12-20 weeks), late pregnancy (> 28 weeks), and at birth on neurodevelopment of infants at 6 months of age. Methods: We included 523 eligible mother-child pairs from the mothers and children environmental health (MOCEH) study, a prospective birth cohort study in Korea. We used linear regression, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and generalized additive models (GAM), to evaluate the effects of exposure to metal mixtures on neurodevelopment of infants aged 6 months. The Korean version of Bayley scale of infant and toddler development-II was used to measure the child's neurodevelopment. Results: Linear regression models showed a significant negative effect of lead exposure during late pregnancy on the mental development index (MDI) [beta = -2.51 (-4.92, -0.10)] scores of infants aged 6 months following co- exposure to mercury. Further, linear regression analysis showed a significant interaction between late pregnancy lead and mercury concentrations. BKMR analysis showed similar results as those obtained in linear regression models. These results were also replicated in the GAM. Stratification analysis showed that greater than 50 percentile concentration of mercury in late pregnancy potentiated the adverse effects of lead in late pregnancy on MDI [beta = -4.33 (-7.66, -1.00)] and psychomotor development index (PDI) [beta = -5.30 (-9.13, -1.46)] at 6 months of age. Prenatal cadmium exposure did not show a significant association with MDI and PDI at 6 months in the linear regression or BKMR analysis. Conclusion: Based on all the statistical methods used, we demonstrated the effect of combined exposure to metals on the neurodevelopment of infants aged 6 months, with significant interaction between lead and mercury.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

W.; Shamlaye, C.","This review examines the role of nutrients in child development and outlines the key nutrients identified as potentially important to neurodevelopment among high fish consumers in the Seychelles Child Development Nutrition Study (SCDNS). It describes the clinical assessment of these nutrients in the blood and breast milk samples collected from the cohort of 300 pregnant women who were recruited, at their first antenatal visit, on the SCDNS. These key nutrients include the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), docosohexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA), both of which may affect neurodevelopment in the later stages of fetal growth. Only DHA, however, is strongly associated with fish consumption, the predominant source of the neurotoxicant methyl mercury (MeHg). Any benefits of increased selenium status on neurodevelopment are likely to accrue via detoxification of MeHg during fetal growth, while benefits of optimal iodine or thyroid status are likely to be directly related to neurodevelopment during late fetal growth. Unlike LCPUFA, Se, and I, the status of the B vitamins, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and riboflavin are unlikely to be closely related to fish consumption but the status of each of these B vitamins is likely to impinge on overall status of choline, which is expected to have direct effects on neurodevelopment both prenatally and postnatally and may also impact on MeHg toxicity. Choline status, together with the status of two other candidate nutrients, zinc and copper, which are also likely to have effects on neurodevelopment prenatally and postnatally, are expected to have some correlation with fish consumption.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Aim(s): To examine the effects of lower levels of alcohol and very early exposure to alcohol on infant temperament and child behavior. Study design, subjects, and outcome measures: The Growing Up in New Zealand study involves a prospective birth cohort of 6822 pregnant women of whom 6156 provided information on their child's temperament using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R VSF) at 9 months and their child's behavior using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 2 years. Result(s): A series of adjusted linear regression models controlling for socio-demographic factors found alcohol consumption during pregnancy was most consistently related to Lower Positive Affect, Affiliation/Regulation, and Orienting Capacity temperament scores. Mothers who stopped drinking after becoming aware of their pregnancy, but had an unplanned pregnancy (hence may have a baby exposed to alcohol for longer), also reported infants with lower Orienting Capacity, Affiliation/Regulation, and Fear temperament scores compared to those that did not drink. Children whose mothers drank four or more drinks per week during pregnancy were more likely to report their child as having conduct problems, with higher total difficulties scores at age 2. Conclusion(s): Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has a negative effect especially on infant temperament, even if small amounts of alcohol are consumed.

Epidemiological studies have shown that children exposed to VPA are at higher risk for ASD during the first trimester of their gestational development. Several animal and human studies have demonstrated important behavioral impairments and morphological changes in the brain following VPA treatment. However, the mechanism of VPA exposure-induced ASD remains unclear. Several factors are involved in the pathological phase of ASD, including aberrant excitation/inhibition of synaptic transmission, neuroinflammation, diminished neurogenesis, oxidative stress, etc. In this review, we aim to outline the current knowledge of the critical pathophysiological mechanisms underlying VPA exposure-induced ASD.

R.; Ahmed, A.; Halder, D.; Mandal, C.","Epigenetic modifications by toxic heavy metals are one of the intensively investigated fields of modern genomic research. Among a diverse group of heavy metals, lead (Pb) is an extensively distributed toxicant causing an immense number of abnormalities in the developing fetus via a wide variety of epigenetic changes. As a divalent cation, Pb can readily cross the placental membrane and the fetal blood brain barrier leading to far-reaching alterations in DNA methylation patterns, histone protein modifications, and micro-RNA expression. Over recent years, several human cohorts and animal model studies have documented hypermethylation and hypomethylation of developmental genes along with altered DNA methyl-transferase expression by in utero Pb exposure in a dose-, duration-, and sex-dependent manner. Modifications in the expression of specific histone acetyltransferase enzymes along with histone acetylation and methylation levels have been reported in rodent and murine models. Apart from these, down-regulation and up-regulation of certain microRNAs crucial for fetal development have been shown to be associated with in utero Pb exposure in human placenta samples. All these modifications in the developing fetus during the prenatal and perinatal stages reportedly caused severe abnormalities in early or adult age, such as impaired growth, obesity, autism, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, risks of cancer development, and Alzheimer's disease. In this review, currently available information on Pb-mediated alterations in the fetal epigenome is summarized.

Numerous studies have shown that Notch inhibition and DNA demethylation promote neural differentiation. Here, we investigated the modulation of autophagy during neural differentiation of hPMSCs, induced by DAPT and 5-Azacytidine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: hPMSCs were treated with DAPT to induce neural differentiation, and the autophagy regulating molecules were used to assess the impact of autophagy on neural differentiation.
RESULTS: The hPMSCs presented with typical mesenchymal stem cell phenotypes, in which the majority of cells expressed CD73, CD90 and CD105. hPMSCs were multipotent, capable of differentiating into mesodermal cells. After treatment with DAPT, hPMSCs upregulated the expression of neuronal genes including SOX2, Nestin, and betaIII-tubulin, and the autophagy genes LC3I/II and Beclin. These genes were further increased when 5-Azacytidine was co-supplemented in the culture medium. The inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine impeded the neural differentiation of hPMSCs, marked by the downregulation of betaIII-tubulin, while the activation of autophagy by valproic acid (VPA) instigated the emergence of betaIII-tubulin-positive cells.
CONCLUSION: During the differentiation process, autophagy was modulated, implying that autophagy could play a significant role during the differentiation of these cells. The blockage and stimulation of autophagy could either hinder or induce the formation of neural-like cells, respectively. Therefore, the refinement of autophagic activity at an appropriate level might improve the efficiency of stem cell differentiation.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

C.","BACKGROUND: Neurodevelopment is a complex process involving both genetic and environmental factors. Prenatal exposure to lead (Pb) has been associated with lower performance on neurodevelopmental tests. Adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes are more frequent and/or more severe when toxic exposures interact with genetic susceptibility.
METHODS: To explore possible loci associated with increased susceptibility to prenatal Pb exposure, we performed a genome-wide gene-environment interaction study (GWIS) in young children from Mexico (n = 390) and Bangladesh (n = 497). Prenatal Pb exposure was estimated by cord blood Pb concentration. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development.
RESULTS: We identified a locus on chromosome 8, containing UNC5D, and demonstrated evidence of its genome-wide significance with mental composite scores (rs9642758, p <sub>meta</sub> = 4.35 x 10<sup>-6</sup>). Within this locus, the joint effects of two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, rs9642758 and rs10503970) had a p-value of 4.38 x 10<sup>-9</sup> for mental composite scores. Correlating GWIS results with in vitro transcriptomic profiles identified one common gene, SLC1A5, which is involved in synaptic function, neuronal development, and excitotoxicity. Further analysis revealed interconnected interactions that formed a large network of 52 genes enriched with oxidative stress genes and neurodevelopmental genes.

K.; Tiemeier, H.","Background: Prenatal exposure to organophosphate (OP) pesticides has been associated with altered neuronal cell development and behavioral changes in animal offspring. However, the few studies investigating the association between prenatal OP pesticide exposure and neurodevelopmental outcomes such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and autistic traits in children produced mixed findings. Objective: The objective of the present study was to examine whether maternal urinary concentrations of OP pesticide metabolites are associated with ADHD and autistic traits in children participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Method: Maternal concentrations of 6 dialkylphosphates (DAPs) were measured using gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in urine samples collected at < 18 weeks, 18-25 weeks, and > 25 weeks of gestation in 784 mother-child pairs. DAP metabolite concentrations were expressed as molar concentrations divided by creatinine levels and log(10) transformed. ADHD traits were measured at ages 3, 6, and 10 years using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (n = 781) and autistic traits were measured at age 6 years using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) (n = 622). First, regression models were fit for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy. Second, we investigated associations for each collection phase separately, and applied a mutually adjusted model in which the effect of prenatal DAP concentrations from each time period on ADHD and autistic traits were jointly estimated. All associations were adjusted for relevant confounders. Results: Median DAP metabolite concentration was 309 nmol/g creatinine at < 18 weeks, 316 nmol/g creatinine at 18-25 weeks, and 308 nmol/g creatinine at > 25 weeks of gestation. Overall, DAP metabolite concentrations were not associated with ADHD traits. For instance, a log(10) increase in averaged total DAP concentrations across gestation was not associated with a lower ADHD score (-0.03 per SD 95 CI: -0.28 to 0.23). Similarly, no associations between maternal DAP concentrations and autistic traits were detected. Conclusions: In this study of maternal urinary DAP metabolite concentrations during pregnancy, we did not observe associations with ADHD and autistic traits in children.

H.; Taneepanichskul, N.","BACKGROUND: Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are the priority heavy metals of major public health concern in industrialized countries. Exposure to them can cause cognitive impairment and depressive disorders through an effect on Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is an important biomarker of pregnancy. Despite a number of prior studies on heavy metals pollution, there is few of studies on the effect of heavy metals on BDNF during early pregnancy. This study aims to examine the association between maternal blood heavy metals concentrations and BDNF during the first trimester pregnancy among Myanmar migrants in Thailand.
METHODOLOGY: This cross sectional study, a part of ongoing birth cohort was conducted at the antenatal care clinic from June to October 2018. A total of 108 with Myanmar migrant pregnancy with a single viable fetus of 0 to 14 gestation weeks who stayed within the industrial plant at least 3 months before were recruited. Socio-demographic characteristics and health behaviors were accessed using a self-report questionnaire. Maternal blood heavy metals (lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As)) were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and plasma BDNF was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariate binary logistic regression were modeled to access the association.
RESULTS: Median (interquartile rank: IQR) concentrations were: BDNF (6.49 (1.79) mug/ml), Pb (2.77 (1.46) mug/dL), Hg (0.62 (0.54) mug/dL), Cd (0.93(0.86) mug/L) and As (0.40 (0.11) mug/dL) respectively. We categorized BDNF concentrations into high (> median) (n = 54) and low (<= median) (n = 54) groups. After adjusting for potential confounders, high blood total arsenic concentration had 2.6-fold increased odds (aOR = 2.603, 95% CI: 1.178, 5.751) of low plasma BDNF level as compared with low blood total arsenic group. However, there was no significant association between BDNF and Pb, Hg and Cd.
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings demonstrate higher blood total arsenic level were more likely to have lower BDNF in early pregnancy. Our study suggested that heavy metal could be worsen BDNF level which plays its important role on biological effect of maternal depressive disorder and newborn neurodevelopment.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

A.; Herting, M. M.; Wozniak, J. R.; Sowell, E. R.; Cifasd","Despite accumulating evidence from animal models demonstrating that prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) results in life-long neuroendocrine dysregulation, very little is known on this topic among humans with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). We expected that alterations in gonadal hormones might interfere with the typical development of white matter (WM) myelination, and in a sex-dependent manner, in human adolescents with FASD. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess: 1) whether or not sex moderates the impact of PAE on WM microstructure; and 2) how gonadal hormones relate to alterations in WM microstructure in children and adolescents affected by PAE.
METHODS: 61 youth (9 to 16 yrs.; 49% girls; 50% PAE) participated as part of the Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD). DTI scans and passive drool samples were obtained to examine neurodevelopmental associations with testosterone (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels in boys and girls, and estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P) levels in girls. Tract-based spatial statistics were utilized to generate fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) for 9 a priori WM regions of interest (ROIs).
RESULTS: As predicted, alterations in FA were observed in adolescents with PAE relative to controls, and these differences varied by sex. Girls with PAE exhibited lower FA (Inferior fronto-occipital and Uncinate fasciculi) while boys with PAE exhibited higher FA (Callosal body, Cingulum, Corticospinal tract, Optic radiation, Superior longitudinal fasciculus) relative to age-matched controls. When gonadal hormone levels were examined in relation to DTI measures, additional group differences in FA were revealed, demonstrating that neuroendocrine factors are associated with PAE-related brain alterations.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide human evidence that PAE relates to sex-specific differences in WM microstructure, and underlying alterations in gonadal hormone function may, in part, contribute to these effects. Determining PAE-effects on neuroendocrine function among humans is an essential first step towards developing novel clinical (e.g., assessment or intervention) tools that target hormone systems to improve on-going brain development among children and adolescents with FASD.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

C.","Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is characterized by disrupted fetal brain development and postnatal cognitive impairment. The targets of alcohol are diverse, and it is not clear whether there are common underlying molecular mechanisms producing these disruptions. Prior work established that acute ethanol exposure causes a transient increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in cultured embryonic cortical cells. In this study, we show that a similar tyrosine phosphorylation transient occurs in the fetal brain after maternal dosing with ethanol. Using phospho-specific antibodies and immunohistochemistry, we mapped regions of highest tyrosine phosphorylation in the fetal cerebral cortex and found that areas of dendritic and axonal growth showed elevated tyrosine phosphorylation 10 min after maternal ethanol exposure. These were also areas of Src expression and Src family kinase (SFK) activation loop phosphorylation (pY416) expression. Importantly, maternal pretreatment with the SFK inhibitor dasatinib completely prevents both the pY416 increase and the tyrosine phosphorylation response. The phosphorylation response was observed in the perisomatic region and neurites of immature migrating and differentiating primary neurons. Importantly, the initial phosphotyrosine transient (~ 30 min) targets both Src and Dab1, two critical elements in Reelin signaling, a pathway required for normal cortical development. This initial phosphorylation response is followed by sustained reduction in Ser3 phosphorylation of n-cofilin, a critical actin severing protein and an identified downstream effector of Reelin signaling. This biochemical disruption is associated with sustained reduction of F-actin content and disrupted Golgi apparatus morphology in developing cortical neurons. The finding outlines a model in which the initial activation of SFKs by ethanol has the potential to disrupt multiple developmentally important signaling systems for several hours after maternal exposure.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

To investigate the associations of in utero arsenic exposure with neonatal neurobehavioral development, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 892 mother-infant pairs from 10 hospitals of different levels in Shanghai, China. The concentrations of arsenic were determined in cord blood samples. Neurobehavioral measures were administered at 3days postpartum in full-term newborns using the neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA). Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios for dichotomous NBNA outcomes. After adjusting for potential confounders, a natural log unit (ln-unit) increase in cord blood arsenic was associated with 90% increased odds of low NBNA score (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62, 2.23). As for clusters, each ln-unit arsenic increase was associated with 47% increased odds of low score for behavior (95% CI: 1.31, 1.66) and 36% increased odds of low score for passive muscle tone (95% CI: 1.23, 1.51).

In boys and in fetuses not having CAH, there is no benefit of early DEX treatment and the risks of this therapy must be thoroughly investigated. High doses of prenatal glucocorticoid might alter the developmental trajectory of the brain into adulthood, even for CAH unaffected subjects treated with DEX for a short term during the first trimester.
OBJECTIVE: The present study investigated brain activation during working memory performance in DEX-treated subjects compared with controls.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We tested 18 participants who were exposed to DEX during the first trimester of fetal life but did not have CAH (8 females; mean age 20.78 [standard deviation (SD), 2.67] years) and 40 control participants (24 females; mean age 20.53 [SD, 2.64]) from a single research institute. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging on a 3T scanner during a verbal and visuospatial working memory task.
RESULTS: We did not observe any differences in brain activity during working memory performance. However, DEX-treated subjects responded faster during the experimental condition of the verbal WM task.

Alcohol-related alterations in brain activation have been found in the parietal lobe during symbolic number processing. However, the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the neural correlates of non-symbolic number comparison and the numerical distance effect have not been investigated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined differences in brain activation associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in five parietal regions involved in number processing during a non-symbolic number comparison task with varying degrees of difficulty. fMRI results are presented for 27 Cape Colored children (6 fetal alcohol syndome (FAS)/partial FAS, 5 heavily exposed (HE) non-sydromal, 16 controls; mean age +/- SD = 11.7 +/- 1.1 years). Fetal alcohol exposure was assessed by interviewing mothers using a timeline follow-back approach. Separate subject analyses were performed in each of five regions of interest, bilateral horizontal intraparietal sulci (IPS), bilateral posterior superior parietal lobules (PSPL), and left angular gyrus (left AG), using the general linear model with predictors for number comparison and difficulty level. Mean percent signal change for each predictor was extracted for each subject for each region to examine group differences and associations with continuous measures of alcohol exposure. Although groups did not differ in performance, controls activated the right PSPL more during non-symbolic number comparison than exposed children, but this was not significant after controlling for maternal smoking, and the right IPS more than children with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS. More heavily exposed children recruited the left AG to a greater extent as task difficulty increased, possibly to compensate, in part, for impairments in function in the PSPL and IPS. Notably, in non-syndromal heavily exposed children activation was impaired in the right PSPL, but spared in the right IPS. These results extend previous findings of poor right IPS recruitment during symbolic number processing in FAS/PFAS, indicating that mental representation of relative quantity is affected by prenatal alcohol exposure for both symbolic and non-symbolic representations of quantity.

In this study, we used an animal-to-human translational strategy to identify key molecular changes that potentially mediated the effects of arsenic exposures on ASD development. In a previously established rat model, we have induced autistic behaviors in rat pups with gestational arsenic exposures (10 and 45 mug/L As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in drinking water). Neuronal apoptosis and the associated epigenetic dysregulations in frontal cortex were assayed to screen potential mediating pathways, which were subsequently validated with qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry analyses. Furthermore, the identified pathway, along with serum levels of 26 elements including arsenic, were characterized in a case-control study with 21 ASD children and 21 age-matched healthy controls. In animals, we found that arsenic exposures caused difficulties of social interaction and increased stereotypic behaviors in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by increased neuronal apoptosis and upregulation of Hipk2-p53 pathway in the frontal cortex. In humans, we found that serum levels of Hipk2 and p53 were 24.7 (95%CI: 8.5 to 43.4) % and 23.7 (95%CI: 10.5 to 38.5) % higher in ASD children than in healthy controls. ASD children had significantly higher serum levels of 15 elements, among which arsenic, silicon, strontium, and vanadium were positively associated with both Hipk2 and p53.

This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective activities of L. rhinocerus sclerotial extracts. Human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived neural lineages exposed to the synthetic glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), were used as the in vitro models. Excess glucocorticoids have been shown to adversely affect fetal brain development and impair differentiation of neural progenitor cells. Screening of different L. rhinocerus sclerotial extracts and DEX on the hESC-derived neural lineages was conducted using cell viability and neurite outgrowth assays. The neuroprotective effects of L. rhinocerus sclerotial extracts against DEX were further evaluated using apoptosis assays and Western blot analysis. Hot aqueous and methanol extracts of L. rhinocerus sclerotium promoted neurite outgrowth of hESC-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) with negligible cytotoxicity. Treatment with DEX decreased viability of NSCs by inducing apoptosis. Coincubation of L. rhinocerus methanol extract with DEX attenuated the DEX-induced apoptosis and reduction in phospho-Akt (pAkt) level in NSCs. These results suggest the involvement of Akt signaling in the neuroprotection of L. rhinocerus methanol extract against DEX-induced apoptosis in NSCs.

Three groups were compared: 1) prenatal exposure to cocaine, alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco (CAMT, n=15), 2) prenatal exposure to alcohol, marijuana, and tobacco (AMT, n=17), and 3) no prenatal exposure to drugs (Controls, n=15). Subjects were frequency matched on gender, race, handedness, and 15-year IQ. This study used the theoretical model proposed by Posner and Peterson (1990), which posits three dissociable components of attention: alerting, orienting, and executive attention. Subjects completed a functional MRI (fMRI) scan while performing the Attention Network Task, a validated neuroimaging measure of the 3-network model of attention. Behavioral and fMRI data revealed no associations between PCE and task accuracy, speed of processing, or activation in key brain regions associated with each of the attention networks. The results of this study show that any subtle differences in brain function associated with PCE are not detectable using the ANT task and fMRI. These results should be interpreted in the context of other studies that have found associations between PCE and arousal with emotionally arousing stimuli, compared to this study that found no associations using emotionally neutral stimuli.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Both are known neurotoxic metals that cause detrimental effects on brain development and lead to deficits in cognitive function and behavioral performance in children. Studies have indicated a potential link between iAs and Pb exposure and a higher risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To provide further insight into whether developmental exposure to iAs or Pb is associated with ASD, we conducted a systematic review and combined data into a meta-analysis to evaluate the available human evidence on the relationships. We systematically reviewed relevant studies published through December 30, 2018 and identified 14 studies on iAs and 37 studies on Pb exposure and their respective associations with ASD. Among them, 8 (53.3%) and 19 (51.3%) studies reported a positive association for iAs and Pb, respectively, and none reported a sole inverse association. In the following meta-analysis, we found statistically significant higher iAs concentrations, in hair and in blood, for children diagnosed with ASD compared with controls across studies. However, the findings on Pb exposure were inconsistent, with a significant association for hair Pb, no association for urinary Pb, and an inverse association for blood Pb. After considering strengths and limitations of the body of research, we concluded that there is consistent evidence supporting a positive association between early life iAs exposure and diagnosis of ASD and inconsistent evidence for Pb exposure and ASD risk. We believe it is in the best interest of policy makers and the public to reduce exposures to iAs and Pb among pregnant women and children. Further, our research supports the need for large perspective human studies with accurate measurement and determination of the long-term body burden of iAs and Pb exposures to assess the impact of iAs and Pb exposures on ASD risk.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Every stage of the UOG lifecycle, from well construction to extraction, operations, transportation and distribution can lead to air and water contamination. Residents near UOG operations can suffer from increased exposure to elevated concentrations of air and water pollutants. Here we focus on five air and water pollutants that have been associated with potentially permanent learning and neuropsychological deficits, neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological birth defects. Given the profound sensitivity of the developing brain and central nervous system, it is reasonable to conclude that young children who experience frequent exposure to these pollutants are at particularly high risk for chronic neurological diseases.

A.; Schwerdtle, T.","SCOPE: In the general population exposure to arsenic occurs mainly via diet. Highest arsenic concentrations are found in seafood, where arsenic is present predominantly in its organic forms including arsenolipids. Since recent studies have provided evidence that arsenolipids could reach the brain of an organism and exert toxicity in fully differentiated human neurons, this work aims to assess the neurodevelopmental toxicity of arsenolipids.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Neurodevelopmental effects of three arsenic-containing hydrocarbons (AsHC), two arsenic-containing fatty acids (AsFA), arsenite and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA<sup>V</sup> ) were characterized in pre-differentiated human neurons. AsHCs and arsenite caused substantial cytotoxicity in a similar, low concentration range, whereas AsFAs and DMA<sup>V</sup> were less toxic. AsHCs were highly accessible for cells and exerted pronounced neurodevelopmental effects, with neurite outgrowth and the mitochondrial membrane potential being sensitive endpoints; arsenite did not substantially decrease those two endpoints. In fully differentiated neurons, arsenite and AsHCs caused neurite toxicity.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate for a neurodevelopmental potential of AsHCs. Taken into account the possibility that AsHCs might easily reach the developing brain when exposed during early life, neurotoxicity and neurodevelopmental toxicity cannot be excluded. Further studies are needed in order to progress the urgently needed risk assessment.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), we compared the neurobehavior at birth of 86 infants born to opioid-dependent mothers receiving methadone treatment (MMT) with 103 infants unexposed to methadone. Generalized linear models, adjusted for covariates, showed methadone exposed infants had significantly poorer attention, regulation, and quality of movement. They were also significantly more excitable, more easily aroused, exhibited more non-optimal reflexes, hypertonicity, and total signs of stress abstinence. Maternal MMT was also associated with more indices of neonatal abstinence, including: CNS, visual, genitourinary (GI), and state.

We evaluated whole-brain FC in a large multi-site sample, examined its cognitive correlates, and explored its potential to objectively identify neurodevelopmental abnormality in individuals without definitive dysmorphic features. Included were 75 children with PAE and 68 controls from four sites. All participants had documented heavy prenatal alcohol exposure. All underwent a formal evaluation of physical anomalies and dysmorphic facial features. MRI data were collected using modified matched protocols on three platforms (Siemens, GE, and Philips). Resting-state FC was examined using whole-brain graph theory metrics to characterize each individual's connectivity. Although whole-brain FC metrics did not discriminate prenatally-exposed from unexposed overall, atypical FC (> 1 standard deviation from the grand mean) was significantly more common (2.7 times) in the PAE group vs. controls. In a subset of 55 individuals (PAE and controls) whose dysmorphology examination could not definitively characterize them as either Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) or non-FAS, atypical FC was seen in 27 % of the PAE group, but 0 % of controls. Across participants, a 1 % difference in local network efficiency was associated with a 36 point difference in global cognitive functioning. Whole-brain FC metrics have potential to identify individuals with objective neurodevelopmental abnormalities from prenatal alcohol exposure. When applied to individuals unable to be classified as FAS or non-FAS from dysmorphology alone, these measures separate prenatally-exposed from non-exposed with high specificity.

J.; Thomas, K. G. F.; Molteno, C. D.; Jacobson, J. L.; Jacobson, S. W.; Meintjes, E. M.","Introduction: Although performance deficits in place learning have been reported in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), neural correlates of these deficits have not been investigated. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of 57 children (41 alcohol-exposed; 16 controls; mean age = 9.4 years; 29 boys) examined effects of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on place learning in a virtual environment, the computer-generated (CG) arena. Method(s): Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired while children passively viewed a recording of an experimenter completing the task. Visible-target blocks involved navigation to a visible platform. During invisible-target blocks, the platform appeared only when the experimenter moved over it. After the scan, all children performed a post-test during which they had to navigate to the location of the invisible platform. Result(s): Although there were no group differences in post-test performance for sex or FASD diagnosis, PAE in boys was associated with poorer performance and reduced activation in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG), precuneus, posterior cingulate, frontal and temporal lobes, caudate, insula, claustrum, lentiform nucleus, and thalamus. By contrast, PAE was not associated with performance or activation in any regions in girls. Discussion and conclusion: Girls and boys are known to use different navigation strategies. Boys rely more on an allocentric navigational strategy and girls more on landmarks. Poorer recruitment of the PHG, a region known to mediate allocentric navigation, in more heavily exposed boys may explain the observed dose-dependent place learning deficit. The absence of PAE effects in girls suggests that landmark-based navigational strategies may be less affected by alcohol exposure. Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms of Mn exposure on neurotransmitter vesicle release are still unclear. The current study investigated whether the protein expression and their interaction of SNARE complex associated proteins were the media between Mn exposure and neurotransmitter vesicle fusion disorders. After the neurons were respectively exposed to Mn (0-200 muM) for 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 h, there were different degrees of cell injury in neurons. According to the results, Mn exposures in subsequent experiments were restricted to concentrations of 100 muM for 0, 6, 12, 18, 24 h. Mn was found to down-regulate the expression of SNAP-25 and up-regulate the expression of VAMP-2 in cultured neurons. Moreover, the interaction of Munc 18 and Syntaxin increased significantly in response to Mn treatment for 18-24h, and the interaction of VAMP-2 and Synaptophysin increased first and then decreased. FM1-43-labeled synaptic vesicles also provided evidence that the treatment with Mn resulted in neurotransmitter vesicle fusion increasing first and then decreasing, which was consistent with the 80 kDa protein levels of SNARE complexes.

However, much uncertainty exists about the brain structural alterations underlying these associations. The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal OP pesticide metabolite concentrations in urine repeatedly measured during gestation are associated with brain morphology and white matter microstructure in 518 preadolescents aged 9-12 years. Method: Data came from 518 mother-child pairs participating in the Generation R Study, a population-based birth cohort from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Maternal urine concentrations were determined for 6 dialkylphosphates (DAPs) including 3 dimethyl (DM) and 3 diethyl (DE) alkyl phosphate metabolites, collected at early, mid, and late pregnancy. At child's age 9-12 years, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to obtain T1-weighted images for brain volumes and surface-based cortical thickness and cortical surface area, and diffusion tensor imaging was used to measure white matter microstructure through fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Linear regression models were fit for the averaged prenatal exposure across pregnancy. Results: DM and DE metabolite concentrations were not associated with brain volumes, cortical thickness, and cortical surface area. However, a 10-fold increase in averaged DM metabolite concentrations across pregnancy was associated with lower FA (B = -1.00, 95%CI = -1.80, -0.20) and higher MD (B = 0.13, 95%CI = 0.04, 0.21). Similar associations were observed for DE concentrations. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that OP pesticides may alter normal white matter microstructure in children, which could have consequences for normal neurodevelopment.

Over 1/3 of the global population is exposed to iodine deficiency, especially in the mountains. Iodine is a component of the thyroid hormones and a strong antioxidant with electric potential of -0.54 V. Iodine as iodide is taken up by the thyroid gland, gastric mucosa, salivary glands and mammary glands in pregnant and breast-feeding women. The transport of iodine to the thyroid gland is regulated by specific enzymes: Natrium Iodine Symporter, Na+/K+ATPase, Pendrin and Apical Iodine Transporter. In the thyrocytes, the thyroid hormones biosynthesis is carried out by iodization of tyrosine to T3 and T4. Secretion of T3 and T4 is regulated by TSH. On the tissue level, the active hormones are T3 and its derivative thyroamine. The most important target is the cardiac muscle, where T3 action results in an increase in the inotropic action and thyroamines exert a negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. The consequences of iodine deficiency are endemic goiter, irreversible brain damage, cretinism, impaired thyroid function and thyroid, gastric and mammary glands cancers. In 1994, the World Health Organization proposed the main strategy for iodine prophylaxis, i.e. Universal Salt Iodization. In Poland, a new model of iodine prophylaxis was introduced in 1996; the model includes obligatory iodization of household salt and neonate formulas and recommendation to take an additional daily dose of iodine for pregnant and breast-feeding women. This model allowed for eliminating endemic goiter in schoolchildren, eradicating cretinism in mountainous areas, and markedly diminished thyroid and gastric cancer incidence.

Dexamethasone (DEX) is used in pregnancies at risk for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) to prevent virilization in an affected female fetus. The safety and long-term consequences of prenatal DEX exposure on the brain are largely unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We investigate whether first-trimester prenatal DEX treatment is associated with alterations in brain structure at adult age, and if these alterations are associated with DNA methylation, mood, and cognitive abilities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging scans, from a single research institute, are compared between 19 (9 women) first-trimester DEX-treated individuals, at risk of CAH but not having CAH, and 43 (26 women) controls (age range, 16.0-26.4 years).
RESULTS: DEX-treated participants showed bilateral enlargement of the amygdala, increased surface area and volume of the left superior frontal gyrus, and widespread increased radial, mean, and axial diffusivity of white matter, in particular in the superior longitudinal fasciculi and corticospinal tracts. In the DEX-treated group, increased mean and radial diffusivity correlated with increased methylation of the promotor region of the FKBP5 gene. There were no group differences in cognition or in scales assessing depression or anxiety, and the relationship between brain structure and cognition did not differ between DEX-treated and controls.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) play an essential role in shaping the developing brain, yet little is known about how Pb perturbs NSC functions and whether such perturbation contributes to impaired neurodevelopment.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify Pb-induced transcriptomic changes in NSCs and to link these changes to neurodevelopmental outcomes in children who were exposed to Pb.
METHODS: We performed RNA-seq-based transcriptomic profiling in human NSCs treated with 1 muM Pb. We used qRT-PCR, Western blotting, ELISA, and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) to characterize Pb-induced gene up-regulation. Through interrogation of a genome-wide association study, we examined the association of gene variants with neurodevelopment outcomes in the ELEMENT birth cohort.
RESULTS: We identified 19 genes with significantly altered expression, including many known targets of NRF2-the master transcriptional factor for the oxidative stress response. Pb induced the expression of SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), which has known neuroprotective effects. We demonstrated that SPP1 is a novel direct NRF2 target gene. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs12641001) in the regulatory region of SPP1 exhibited a statistically significant association (p = 0.005) with the Cognitive Development Index (CDI).

90172057,https://sysrev.com/p/119552/article/90172057,Atypical Value-Driven Selective Attention in Young Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder,JAMA Netw. Open,"Wang, Q.; Chang, J.; Chawarska, K.","Question Is there an association between value learning and atypical selective attention in young children with autism spectrum disorder? Findings This case-control study included 115 preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, or typical development whose selective attention was examined after a value learning protocol in social and nonsocial domains. Unlike comparison groups, children with autism spectrum disorder showed strong evidence for value learning in the nonsocial domain but not in the social domain. Meaning Atypical selective attention in autism spectrum disorder is associated with enhanced value learning in the nonsocial domain and with poor value learning in the social domain, suggesting that value learning may represent a novel treatment target in autism spectrum disorder. Importance Enhanced selective attention toward nonsocial objects and impaired attention to social stimuli constitute key clinical features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, the mechanisms associated with atypical selective attention in ASD are poorly understood, which limits the development of more effective interventions. In typically developing individuals, selective attention to social and nonsocial stimuli is associated with the informational value of the stimuli, which is typically learned over the course of repeated interactions with the stimuli. Objective To examine value learning (VL) of social and nonsocial stimuli and its association with selective attention in preschoolers with and without ASD. Design, Setting, and Participants This case-control study compared children with ASD vs children with developmental delay (DD) and children with typical development (TD) recruited between March 3, 2017, and June 13, 2018, at a university-based research laboratory. Participants were preschoolers with ASD, DD, or TD. Main Outcomes and Measures Procedure consisted of an eye-tracking gaze-contingent VL task involving social (faces) and nonsocial (fractals) stimuli and consisting of baseline, training, and choice test phases. Outcome measures were preferential attention to stimuli reinforced (high value) vs not reinforced (low value) during training. The hypotheses were stated before data collection. Results Included were 115 preschoolers with ASD (n = 48; mean [SD] age, 38.30 [15.55] months; 37 [77%] boys), DD (n = 31; mean [SD] age, 45.73 [19.49] months; 19 [61%] boys), or TD (n = 36; mean [SD] age, 36.53 [12.39] months; 22 [61%] boys). The groups did not differ in sex distribution; participants with ASD or TD had similar chronological age; and participants with ASD or DD had similar verbal IQ and nonverbal IQ. After training, the ASD group showed preference for the high-value nonsocial stimuli (mean proportion, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.56-0.65]; P < .001) but not for the high-value social stimuli (mean proportion, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.46-0.56]; P = .58). In contrast, the DD and TD groups demonstrated preference for the high-value social stimuli (DD mean proportion, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.54-0.64]; P = .001 and TD mean proportion, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.53-0.61]; P = .002) but not for the high-value nonsocial stimuli (DD mean proportion, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.44-0.59]; P = .64 and TD mean proportion, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.44-0.57]; P = .91). Controlling for age and nonverbal IQ, autism severity was positively correlated with enhanced learning in the nonsocial domain (r = 0.22; P = .03) and with poorer learning in the social domain (r = -0.26; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Increased attention to objects in preschoolers with ASD may be associated with enhanced VL in the nonsocial domain. When paired with poor VL in the social domain, enhanced value-driven attention to objects may play a formative role in the emergence of autism symptoms by altering attentional priorities and thus learning opportunities in affected children. This case-control study examines value learning of social and nonsocial stimuli and its association with selective attention in preschoolers with and without autism spectrum disorder.",,0,WP2,0,0

Here, we present data on nicotinic receptor binding, as determined by <sup>125</sup>I-epibatidine receptor autoradiography, in the brainstems of infants dying of SIDS and of other known causes of death collected from the Safe Passage Study, a prospective, multicenter study with clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa and 5 United States sites, including 2 American Indian Reservations. We examined 15 pons and medulla regions related to cardiovascular control and arousal in infants dying of SIDS (n = 12) and infants dying from known causes (n = 20, 10 pre-discharge from time of birth, 10 post-discharge). Overall, there was a developmental decrease in <sup>125</sup>I-epibatidine binding with increasing postconceptional age in 5 medullary sites [raphe obscurus, gigantocellularis, paragigantocellularis, centralis, and dorsal accessory olive (p = 0.0002-0.03)], three of which are nuclei containing serotonin cells. Comparing SIDS with post-discharge known cause of death (post-KCOD) controls, we found significant decreased binding in SIDS in the nucleus pontis oralis (p = 0.02), a critical component of the cholinergic ascending arousal system of the rostral pons (post-KCOD, 12.1 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg and SIDS, 9.1 +/- 0.78 fmol/mg). In addition, we found an effect of maternal smoking in SIDS (n = 11) combined with post-KCOD controls (n = 8) on the raphe obscurus (p = 0.01), gigantocellularis (p = 0.02), and the paragigantocellularis (p = 0.002), three medullary sites found in this study to have decreased binding with age and found in previous studies to have abnormal indices of serotonin neurotransmission in SIDS infants. At these sites, <sup>125</sup>I-epibatidine binding increased with increasing cigarettes per week. We found no effect of maternal drinking on <sup>125</sup>I-epibatidine binding at any site measured. Taken together, these data support changes in nicotinic receptor binding related to development, cause of death, and exposure to maternal cigarette smoking. These data present new evidence in a prospective study supporting the roles of developmental factors, as well as adverse exposure on nicotinic receptors, in serotonergic nuclei of the rostral medulla-a finding that highlights the interwoven and complex relationship between acetylcholine (via nicotinic receptors) and serotonergic neurotransmission in the medulla. © Copyright © 2021 Vivekanandarajah, Nelson, Kinney, Elliott, Folkerth, Tran, Cotton, Jacobs, Minter, McMillan, Duncan, Broadbelt, Schissler, Odendaal, Angal, Brink, Burger, Coldrey, Dempers, Boyd, Fifer, Geldenhuys, Groenewald, Holm, Myers, Randall, Schubert, Sens, Wright, Roberts, Nelsen, Wadee, Zaharie, Haynes and PASS Network.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

P.; El-Hage, N.","The overall goal of this study is to elucidate the potential effect(s) of arsenic on a variety of human brain cells. Arsenic is the most pervasive Group A human environmental carcinogen. Long-term exposure to arsenic is associated with human diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. More immediate are the health effects on neurological development and associated disorders in infants and children exposed to arsenic in utero. Arsenic is metabolized in various organs and tissues into more toxic methylated species, including methylarsenite (MAs(III)), so the question arises whether the methylate species are responsible for the neurological effects of arsenic. Arsenic enters the brain through the blood-brain barrier and produces toxicity in the brain microvascular endothelial cells, glia (astrocytes and microglia), and neurons. In this study, we first assessed the toxicity in different types of brain cells exposed to either inorganic trivalent As(III) or MAs(III) using both morphological and cytotoxicity cell-based analysis. Second, we determined the methylation of arsenicals and the expression levels of the methylation enzyme, As(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase (AS3MT), in several types of brain cells. We showed that the toxicity to neurons of MAs(III) was significantly higher than that of As(III). Interestingly, the differences in cytotoxicity between cell types was not due to expression of AS3MT, as this was expressed in neurons and glia but not in endothelial cells. These results support our hypothesis that MAs(III) is the likely physiological neurotoxin rather than inorganic arsenic species.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

We aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and increased odds of ASD among 2 to 10-year-old children. We conducted a case-control study in Tehran, Iran. Cases were 134 children born between 2004 and 2012 diagnosed with ASD whose mothers were resident in Tehran during their pregnancy, and controls were 388 children without ASD randomly selected from public schools and kindergartens. Land-use regression models were used to estimate their annual mean exposure to ambient particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <=10mum (PM<sub>10</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, p-xylene, o-xylene, m-xylene (BTEX), and total BTEX. Logistic regression was used for the analyses and adjusted for possible confounding variables. The odds ratios per 1 unit increase in pollutants in the adjusted models were 1.00 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.01) for PM<sub>10</sub>, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.00) for SO<sub>2</sub>, 0.96 (0.83, 1.11) for benzene, 1.00 (0.96, 1.04) for toluene, 0.95 (0.79, 1.16) for ethylbenzene, 1.00 (0.78, 1.27) for p-xylene, 1.09 (0.94, 1.27) for o-xylene, 1.01 (0.92, 1.12) for m-xylene, and 0.99 (0.97, 1.01) for total BTEX. We did not find the evidence of association between estimated annual mean exposure to abovementioned ambient air pollutants and increased odds of ASD in children. However, our findings might be due to some important limitations.

M.; Farina, M.; da Rocha, J. B. T.; Aschner, M.","Methylmercury (MeHg) is a potent neurotoxin that affects particularly the developing brain. Since MeHg is a potent electrophilic agent, a wide range of intracellular effects occur in response to its exposure. Yet, the molecular mechanisms associated with MeHg-induced cell toxicity have yet to be fully understood. Activation of cell defense mechanisms in response to metal exposure, including the up-regulation of Nrf2- (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2)-related genes has been previously shown. Nrf2 is a key regulator of cellular defenses against oxidative, electrophilic and environmental stress, regulating the expression of antioxidant proteins, phase-II xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes as well phase-III xenobiotic transporters. Analogous to other electrophiles, MeHg activates Nrf2 through modification of its repressor Keap1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1). However, recent findings have also revealed that Keap1-independent signal pathways might contribute to MeHg-induced Nrf2 activation and cytoprotective responses against MeHg exposure. These include, Akt phosphorylation (Akt/GSK-3beta/Fyn-mediated Nrf2 activation pathway), activation of the PTEN/Akt/CREB pathway and MAPK-induced autophagy and p62 expression. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art knowledge regarding Nrf2 up-regulation in response to MeHg exposure, highlighting the modulation of signaling pathways related to Nrf2 activation. The study of these mechanisms is important in evaluating MeHg toxicity in humans, and can contribute to the identification of the molecular mechanisms associated with MeHg exposure.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

P.; Gaidin, S. G.; Teplov, I. Y.; Kosenkov, A. M.; Sergeev, A. I.; Dolgacheva, L. P.; Tuleuhanov, S. T.","Abstract: Calcium-permeable kainate (CP-KARs) and AMPA (CP-AMPARs) receptors of the brain neurons are active participants of synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release trigger. In this paper, CP-KARs and CP-AMPARs were identified in hippocampal neuroglial culture on 14-17 day of cultivation by a characteristic Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to a selective agonist of CP-KARs and CP-AMPARs, domoic acid (DA), and to a selective agonist of CP-KARs, ATPA. It was shown that DA at a concentration of 300 nM caused a rapid intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increase in two minor subpopulations of neurons. Both subpopulations were found to be GABAergic neurons that were positively stained with antibodies against glutamate decarboxylase 65 and 67 (GAD65/67). The antagonist of CP-AMPARs, NASPM, did not suppress Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to DA in the neurons of the first subpopulation. The selective agonist of CP-KARs, ATPA, increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<inf>i</inf> to the same extent as DA only in the first subpopulation of GABAergic neurons. An inhibitor of GABA(A) receptors, bicuculline, did not increase the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to DA in this subpopulation, indicating the absence of CP-KARs in the postsynaptic membrane, where GABA(A) receptors are located. Thus, these GABAergic neurons can be attributed to neurons containing CP-KARs, which are apparently located in the presynaptic membrane of the GABAergic neurons. The [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<inf>i</inf> increase caused by the DA application in the second subpopulation was completely suppressed by NASPM, an inhibitor of CP-AMPARs. NASPM reduced the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations amplitude in the same subset, indicating the involvement of CP-AMPARs in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> impulse formation during synchronous calcium activity. For this reason, the neurons of this subpopulation can be attributed to the GABAergic neurons containing CP-AMPARs. Most of the neurons in the hippocampal cell culture (70-85%) were not stained with antibodies against GAD65/67 and responded to the DA by increasing the calcium oscillations frequency with a delay. The amplitude of DA-induced oscillations increased in the presence of NASPM in the subpopulation of inhibitory neurons containing CP-KARs, indicating their innervation by inhibitory neurons containing CP-AMRARs. This increase in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation amplitude in the inhibitory neurons containing CP-KARs correlated with a decrease in the amplitude of synchronous calcium activity in a large subpopulation (42 +/- 6% of cells) of glutamatergic neurons, suggesting innervation of the latter by inhibitory neurons containing CP-KARs. Thus, GABAergic neurons containing CP-KARs and CP-AMPARs can work in tandem, controlling the activity of individual subpopulations of neurons. Copyright © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,WP1,0,0,0

Methods Two Japanese children with progressive microcephaly born to unrelated patients were analyzed by whole exome sequencing and novel ASNS mutations were identified. The effects of the ASNS mutations were analyzed by structural evaluation and in silico predictions. Results We describe the first known Japanese patients with ASNS deficiency. Their clinical manifestations were very similar to reported cases of ASNS deficiency. Progressive microcephaly was noted during the prenatal period in patient 1 but only after birth in patient 2. Both patients had novel ASNS mutations: patient 1 had p.L145S transmitted from his mother and p.L247W which was absent from his mother, while patient 2 carried p.V489D and p.W541Cfs*5, which were transmitted from his mother and father, respectively. Three of the four mutations were predicted to affect protein folding, and in silico analyses suggested that they would be pathogenic.

W.","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are characterized by a range of neurodevelopmental deficits that result from prenatal exposure to alcohol. These can include cognitive, behavioural, and neurological impairment, as well as structural and functional brain damage. Eyeblink conditioning (EBC) is among the most sensitive endpoints affected in FASD. The cerebellar peduncles, large bundles of myelinated nerve fibers that connect the cerebellum to the brainstem, constitute the principal white matter element of the EBC circuit. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is used to assess white matter integrity in fibre pathways linking brain regions. DTI scans of 54 children with FASD and 23 healthy controls, mean age 10.1 +/- 1.0 years, from the Cape Town Longitudinal Cohort were processed using voxelwise group comparisons. Prenatal alcohol exposure was related to lower fractional anisotropy (FA) bilaterally in the superior cerebellar peduncles and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the left middle peduncle, effects that remained significant after controlling for potential confounding variables. Lower FA and higher MD in these regions were associated with poorer EBC performance. Moreover, effects of alcohol exposure on EBC decreased significantly after inclusion of these DTI measures in regression models, suggesting that these white matter deficits partially mediate the relation of prenatal alcohol exposure to EBC. The associations of greater alcohol consumption with these DTI measures are largely attributable to greater radial diffusivity, possibly indicating poorer myelination. Thus, these data suggest that fetal alcohol-related deficits in EBC are attributable, in part, to poorer myelination in key regions of the cerebellar peduncles. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2470-2482, 2015.

A verbal n-back task (1-back and 0-back) was administered to 47 children (17 with FAS/PFAS, 13 HE, and 17 controls) during fMRI.

Whereas groups did not differ in task sensitivity, fMRI analyses suggested different patterns of sub-network recruitment across groups. Controls primarily recruited left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). By contrast, HE primarily recruited an extensive set of fronto-striatal regions, including left dPFC and left caudate, and the FAS/PFAS group relied primarily on two cerebellar subregions and parietal cortex. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate differential recruitment of critical brain regions that subserve basic function in children with different fetal alcohol spectrum disorders compared to controls.

E.; Szyf, M.; Benkelfat, C.","BACKGROUND: Despite more than 60 years of research in the role of serotonin (5-HT) in psychopathology, many questions still remain. From a developmental perspective, studies have provided more insight into how 5-HT dysfunctions acquired in utero or early in life may modulate brain development. This paper discusses the relevance of the developmental role of 5-HT for the understanding of psychopathology. We review developmental milestones of the 5-HT system, how genetic and environmental 5-HT disturbances could affect brain development and the potential role of DNA methylation in 5-HT genes for brain development. METHODS: Studies were identified using common databases (e.g., PubMed, Google Scholar) and reference lists. RESULTS: Despite the widely supported view that the 5-HT system matures in early life, different 5-HT receptors, proteins and enzymes have different developmental patterns, and development is brain region-specific. A disruption in 5-HT homeostasis during development may lead to structural and functional changes in brain circuits that modulate emotional stress responses, including subcortical limbic and (pre)frontal areas. This may result in a predisposition to psychopathology. DNA methylation might be one of the underlying physiologic mechanisms. LIMITATIONS: There is a need for prospective studies. The impact of stressors during adolescence on the 5-HT system is understudied. Questions regarding efficacy of drugs acting on 5-HT still remain. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary and longitudinal approach in designing studies on the role of 5-HT in psychopathology might help to bring us closer to the understanding of the role of 5-HT in psychopathology.",,WP1,0,0,0

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are reported to be a promising cell source for evaluating chemical teratogenicity, because they are capable of reproducing embryonic developmental model and enable reduction in the number of experimental animals used. We previously investigated 22 genes for which expressions are altered by teratogens, specifically focusing on neural differentiation of mouse ESCs. In the present study, expressions of the investigated genes were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and compared during differentiation of human ESCs into neurons with or without VPA. Under the conditions, almost all gene expressions significantly changed in VPA-containing culture. Specifically, in neural development-related genes such as DCX, ARX, MAP2, and NNAT, more than 2-fold expression was observed. The findings suggest that the genes focused on in this study may help to elucidate the teratogenic effects of VPA and might be a useful tool to analyze embryotoxic potential of chemicals in humans.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

Assessments included Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Child Behavior Checklist and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function.

Analyses examined group-by-age interactions and group-score interactions for correlations between change in volume and raw behavioral scores. Results showed that subjects with PAE had smaller volumes than control subjects across the brain. Significant group-score interactions were found in temporal and parietal regions for WISC arithmetic scores and in frontal and parietal regions for behavioral measures. Poorer cognitive/ behavioral outcomes were associated with larger volume increases in PAE, while control subjects generally showed no significant correlations. In contrast with previous results demonstrating different trajectories of cortical volume change in PAE, our results show similar rates of subcortical volume growth in subjects with PAE and control subjects.

the two control groups were women without epilepsy and women with epilepsy who were not taking aeds during pregnancy. data collection and analysis: three authors (rb, jw and jg) independently selected studies for inclusion. data extraction and risk of bias assessments were completed by five authors (rb, jw, as, na, ajm). the primary outcome was global cognitive functioning. secondary outcomes included deficits in specific cognitive domains or prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders. due to substantial variation in study design and outcome reporting only limited data synthesis was possible. main results: twenty-two prospective cohort studies were included and six registry based studies. study quality varied. more recent studies tended to be larger and to report individual aed outcomes from blinded assessments, which indicate improved methodological quality.the developmental quotient (dq) was lower in children exposed to carbamazepine (cbz) (n = 50) than in children born to women without epilepsy (n = 79); mean difference (md) of -5.58 (95% confidence interval (ci) -10.83 to -0.34, p = 0.04). the dq of children exposed to cbz (n = 163) was also lower compared to children of women with untreated epilepsy (n = 58) (md -7.22, 95% ci -12.76 to - 1.67, p = 0.01). further analysis using a random-effects model indicated that these results were due to variability within the studies and that there was no significant association with cbz. the intelligence quotient (iq) of older children exposed to cbz (n = 150) was not lower than that of children born to women without epilepsy (n = 552) (md -0.03, 95% ci -3.08 to 3.01, p = 0.98). similarly, children exposed to cbz (n = 163) were not poorer in terms of iq in comparison to the children of women with untreated epilepsy (n = 87) (md 1.84, 95% ci -2.13 to 5.80, p = 0.36). the dq in children exposed to sodium valproate (vpa) (n = 123) was lower than the dq in children of women with untreated epilepsy (n = 58) (md -8.72, 95% -14.31 to -3.14, p = 0.002). the iq of children exposed to vpa (n = 76) was lower than for children born to women without epilepsy (n = 552) (md -8.94, 95% ci -11.96 to -5.92, p < 0.00001). children exposed to vpa (n = 89) also had lower iq than children born to women with untreated epilepsy (n = 87) (md -8.17, 95% ci -12.80 to -3.55, p = 0.0005). in terms of drug comparisons, in younger children there was no significant difference in the dq of children exposed to cbz (n = 210) versus vpa (n=160) (md 4.16, 95% ci -0.21 to 8.54, p = 0.06). however, the iq of children exposed to vpa (n = 112) was significantly lower than for those exposed to cbz (n = 191) (md 8.69, 95% ci 5.51 to 11.87, p < 0.00001). the iq of children exposed to cbz (n = 78) versus lamotrigine (ltg) (n = 84) was not significantly different (md -1.62, 95% ci -5.44 to 2.21, p = 0.41). there was no significant difference in the dq of children exposed to cbz (n = 172) versus phenytoin (pht) (n = 87) (md 3.02, 95% ci -2.41 to 8.46, p = 0.28). the iq abilities of children exposed to cbz (n = 75) were not different from the abilities of children exposed to pht (n = 45) (md -3.30, 95% ci -7.91 to 1.30, p = 0.16). iq was significantly lower for children exposed to vpa (n = 74) versus ltg (n = 84) (md -10.80, 95% ci -14.42 to -7.17, p < 0.00001). dq was higher in children exposed to pht (n = 80) versus vpa (n = 108) (md 7.04, 95% ci 0.44 to 13.65, p = 0.04). similarly iq was higher in children exposed to pht (n = 45) versus vpa (n = 61) (md 9.25, 95% ci 4.78 to 13.72, p < 0.0001). a dose effect for vpa was reported in six studies, with higher doses (800 to 1000 mg daily or above) associated with a poorer cognitive outcome in the child. we identified no convincing evidence of a dose effect for cbz, pht or ltg. studies not included in the meta-analysis were reported narratively, the majority of which supported the findings of the meta-analyses. authors' conclusions: the most important finding is the reduction in iq in the vpa exposed group, which are sufficient to affect education and occupational outcomes in later life. however, for some women vpa is the most effective drug at controlling seizures. informed treatment decisions require detailed counselling about these risks at treatment initiation and at pre-conceptual counselling. we have insufficient data about newer aeds, some of which are commonly prescribed, and further research is required. most women with epilepsy should continue their medication during pregnancy as uncontrolled seizures also carries a maternal risk. â© 2014 the cochrane collaboration.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Using voxelwise analyses, children with FAS/PFAS showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in four white matter (WM) regions and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in seven; three regions of FA and MD differences (left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), splenium, and isthmus) overlapped, and the fourth FA cluster was located in the same WM bundle (right ILF) as an MD cluster. HE children showed lower FA and higher MD in a subset of these regions. Significant correlations were observed between three continuous alcohol measures and DTI values at cluster peaks, indicating that WM damage in several regions is dose dependent. Lower FA in the regions of interest was attributable primarily to increased radial diffusivity rather than decreased axonal diffusivity, suggesting poorer axon packing density and/or myelination. Multiple regression models indicated that this cortical WM impairment partially mediated adverse effects of PAE on information processing speed and eyeblink conditioning.

M.","Background: There is considerable discussion over the possible harm caused by fetal exposure to mercury, but evidence of such harm is contradictory at levels commonly found in populations with moderate intakes of fish. Further information is needed to inform debate and clarify policy recommendations. Material: Data were collected prospectively for the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Whole blood taken in the first half of pregnancy was assayed for mercury. The outcomes were offspring behavioural assessments collected using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at seven time points between ages 4 and 16-17 years; five were completed by the mother and two by the teacher. Socioeconomic and biological confounders were first taken into account; further analyses added maternal blood selenium. Separate analyses compared the relationships between prenatal mercury levels and behaviour traits treated as continuous measures in women who ate fish with those who ate no fish in order to determine whether the relationships differed; the hypothesis was that fish consumption had benefits on the brain and masked any mercury effects. In order to prevent Type II errors, the P value for significance was set at 0.10. Results: Prenatal mercury measurements and offspring behaviour results were available for between 2776 (at 47 months) to 1599 mother-child pairs (at 16-17 years). Even given a P value of 0.10, the number of significant results was no greater than expected apart from the relationships with peer problems at 4, 6 and 10-11 years where the relationships with prenatal mercury were negative (i.e. the greater the level of mercury the fewer the problems the child had with his/her peers). There were no significant differences between the associations with mercury found among the offspring of women who ate fish in pregnancy and those who did not, nor did adjustment for selenium make a difference. Conclusions: There were no adverse effects of maternal prenatal mercury levels on the behaviour of the offspring. A similar lack of relationship was found when the analyses were confined to those offspring whose mothers had eaten fish in pregnancy, and no consistent differences were found between the fish and non-fish eaters.

G.; de Laat, R.; Tagliaferri, S.; Pellacani, C.","Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), extensively used in the past few decades as flame retardants in a variety of consumer products, have become world-wide persistent environmental pollutants. Levels in North America are usually higher than those in Europe and Asia, and body burden is 3-to-9-fold higher in infants and toddlers than in adults. The latter has raised concern for potential developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity of PBDEs. Experimental studies in animals and epidemiological observations in humans suggest that PBDEs may be developmental neurotoxicants. Pre- and/or post-natal exposure to PBDEs may cause long-lasting behavioral abnormalities, particularly in the domains of motor activity and cognition. The mechanisms underlying the developmental neurotoxic effects of PBDEs are not known, though several hypotheses have been put forward. One general mode of action relates to the ability of PBDEs to impair thyroid hormone homeostasis, thus indirectly affecting the developing brain. An alternative or additional mode of action involves a direct effect of PBDEs on nervous system cells; PBDEs can cause oxidative stress-related damage (DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis), and interfere with signal transduction (particularly calcium signaling), and with neurotransmitter systems. Important issues such as bioavailability and metabolism of PBDEs, extrapolation of results to low level of exposures, and the potential effects of interactions among PBDE congeners and between PBDEs and other contaminants also need to be taken into account.

VPA is also known to inhibit histone deacetylases (HDACs) and to cause diverse effects on neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons. Although the neuroprotective or neurodestructive effects of VPA have been investigated in heterogeneous cell populations, in this study, we used homogeneous populations of NPCs and glutamatergic cortical pyramidal neurons, which were differentiated from embryonic stem (ES) cells. At therapeutic concentrations, VPA had a proapoptotic effect on ES cell-derived NPCs of glutamatergic neurons, but not on their progeny. This effect of VPA most likely occurred through the inhibition of HDACs, because similar phenotypes were observed following treatment with other HDAC inhibitors (HDACis) such as trichostatin A and sodium butyrate. The proapoptotic phenotype was not observed when cells were exposed to a structural analog of VPA, valpromide (VPM), which has the same antiepileptic effect as VPA, but does not inhibit HDACs. Western blotting confirmed that treatment with HDACis, but not VPM, significantly increased the levels of histone H3 acetylation in NPCs. HDACi treatments did not affect the survival of neurons, although the acetylation levels were increased to a limited extent. These results, which are based on a homogeneous culture system, suggest that VPA inhibits HDAC activity and induces the apoptosis of NPCs that are fated to differentiate into glutamatergic neurons. The dose-dependent effects of VPA both on apoptosis and hyperacetylation of histone H3 in NPCs supported this notion. These cell type- and differentiation stage-specific effects of VPA imply that dysfunction of HDACs during pregnancy significantly increase the risk of congenital malformations associated with VPA administration.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

M.","Introduction: There is evidence that high levels of mercury exposure to the pregnant woman can result in damage to the brain of the developing fetus. However there is uncertainty as to whether lower levels of the metal have adverse effects on the development of the infant and whether components of fish consumption and/or the selenium status of the woman is protective. Methods: In this study we analysed data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (n = 2875-3264) to determine whether levels of total blood mercury of pregnant women collected in the first half of pregnancy are associated with the development of the offspring at ages 6, 18, 30 and 42 months. The developmental measures used maternal self-reported scales for individual types of development (fine and gross motor, social and communication skills) and total scores. Multiple and logistic regression analyses treated the outcomes both as continuous and as suboptimal (the lowest 15th centile). The statistical analyses first examined the association of prenatal mercury exposure with these developmental endpoints and then adjusted each for a number of social and maternal lifestyle factors; finally this model was adjusted for the blood selenium level. Results: Total maternal prenatal blood mercury and selenium ranged from 0.17 to 12.76 and 17.0 to 324 p.g/L respectively. We found no evidence to suggest that prenatal levels of maternal blood mercury were associated with adverse development of the child, even when the mother had consumed no fish during pregnancy. In general, the higher the mercury level the more advanced the development of the child within the range of exposure studied. For example, the fully adjusted effect sizes for total development at 6 and 42 months were +0.51 [95%CI +0.05, +1.00] and +0.43 [95%Cl +0.08, +0.78] points per SD of mercury. For the risk of suboptimal development the ORs at these ages were 0.90 [95%CI 0.80, 1.02] and 0.88 [95%CI 0.77, 1.02]. In regard to the associations between blood mercury and child development there were no differences between the mothers who ate fish and those who did not, thus implying that the benefits were not solely due to the beneficial nutrients in fish. Conclusions: We found no evidence of adverse associations between maternal prenatal blood mercury and child development between 6 and 42 months of age. The significant associations that were present were all in the beneficial direction. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

M.; Wallace, K.; Shafer, T. J.; Mundy, W. R.","High-throughput methods are useful for rapidly screening large numbers of chemicals for biological activity, including the perturbation of pathways that may lead to adverse cellular effects. In vitro assays for the key events of neurodevelopment, including apoptosis, may be used in a battery of tests for detecting chemicals that could result in developmental neurotoxicity. Apoptosis contributes to nervous system development by regulating the size of the neuroprogenitor cell pool, and the balance between cellular proliferation and apoptosis during neuroprogenitor cell proliferation helps to determine the size and shape of the nervous system. Therefore, chemicals that affect apoptosis during neuronal development can have deleterious effects on the developing brain. The present study examined the utility of a high-throughput assay to detect chemical-induced apoptosis in mouse or human neuroprogenitor cells, as well as differentiated human neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. Apoptosis was assessed using an assay that measures enzymatic activity of caspase-3/7 in a rapid and cost efficient manner. The results show that all three commercially available models generated a robust source of proliferating neuroprogenitor cells, and that the assay was sensitive and reproducible when used in a multi-well plate format. There were differences in the response of rodent and human neuroprogenitor cells to a set of chemicals previously shown to induce apoptosis in vitro. Neuroprogenitor cells were more sensitive to chemical-induced apoptosis than differentiated neurons, suggesting that neuroprogenitor cells are one of the cell models that should be considered for use in a developmental neurotoxicity screening battery.

On the basis of age and gender, we matched 113 children prenatally exposed to tobacco with 113 unexposed controls. These children were part of a population-based study in the Netherlands, the Generation R Study, and were followed from pregnancy onward. Behavioral and emotional functioning was assessed at age 6 with the Child Behavior Checklist. We assessed brain morphology using magnetic resonance imaging techniques in children aged 6-8 years. Children exposed to tobacco throughout pregnancy have smaller total brain volumes and smaller cortical gray matter volumes. Continued prenatal tobacco exposure was associated with cortical thinning, primarily in the superior frontal, superior parietal, and precentral cortices. These children also demonstrated increased scores of affective problems. In addition, thickness of the precentral and superior frontal cortices was associated with affective problems. Importantly, brain development in offspring of mothers who quit smoking during pregnancy resembled that of nonexposed controls (no smaller brain volumes and no thinning of the cortex). Our findings suggest an association between continued prenatal tobacco exposure and brain structure and function in school-aged children.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

The study aimed to determine if differential long-term neurodevelopmental effects exist across four commonly used AEDs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, and valproate). In this report, we examine fetal AED exposure effects on adaptive and emotional/behavioral functioning at 6years of age in 195 children (including three sets of twins) whose parent (in most cases, the mother) completed at least one of the rating scales. Adjusted mean scores for the four AED groups were in the low average to average range for parent ratings of adaptive functioning on the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition (ABAS-II) and for parent and teacher ratings of emotional/behavioral functioning on the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC). However, children whose mothers took valproate during pregnancy had significantly lower General Adaptive Composite scores than the lamotrigine and phenytoin groups. Further, a significant dose-related performance decline in parental ratings of adaptive functioning was seen for both valproate and phenytoin. Children whose mothers took valproate were also rated by their parents as exhibiting significantly more atypical behaviors and inattention than those in the lamotrigine and phenytoin groups. Based upon BASC parent and teacher ratings of attention span and hyperactivity, children of mothers who took valproate during their pregnancy were at a significantly greater risk for a diagnosis of ADHD. The increased likelihood of difficulty with adaptive functioning and ADHD with fetal valproate exposure should be communicated to women with epilepsy who require antiepileptic medication. Finally, additional research is needed to confirm these findings in larger prospective study samples, examine potential risks associated with other AEDs, better define the risks to the neonate that are associated with AEDs for treatment of seizures, and understand the underlying mechanisms of adverse AED effects on the immature brain.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

J.","Alcohol-related diseases of the nervous system are caused by excessive exposures to alcohol, with or without co-existing nutritional or vitamin deficiencies. Toxic and metabolic effects of alcohol (ethanol) vary with brain region, age/developmental stage, dose, and duration of exposures. In the mature brain, heavy chronic or binge alcohol exposures can cause severe debilitating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and skeletal muscle. Most commonly, long-standing heavy alcohol abuse leads to disproportionate loss of cerebral white matter and impairments in executive function. The cerebellum (especially the vermis), cortical-limbic circuits, skeletal muscle, and peripheral nerves are also important targets of chronic alcohol-related metabolic injury and degeneration. Although all cell types within the nervous system are vulnerable to the toxic, metabolic, and degenerative effects of alcohol, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and synaptic terminals are major targets, accounting for the white matter atrophy, neural inflammation and toxicity, and impairments in synaptogenesis. Besides chronic degenerative neuropathology, alcoholics are predisposed to develop severe potentially life-threatening acute or subacute symmetrical hemorrhagic injury in the diencephalon and brainstem due to thiamine deficiency, which exerts toxic/metabolic effects on glia, myelin, and the microvasculature. Alcohol also has devastating neurotoxic and teratogenic effects on the developing brain in association with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder/fetal alcohol syndrome. Alcohol impairs function of neurons and glia, disrupting a broad array of functions including neuronal survival, cell migration, and glial cell (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) differentiation. Further progress is needed to better understand the pathophysiology of this exposure-related constellation of nervous system diseases and better correlate the underlying pathology with in vivo imaging and biochemical lesions.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development defects induced by maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unclear. We used normal and Hsf2-deficient mice and cell systems to uncover a pivotal role for heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) in radial neuronal migration defects in the cortex, a hallmark of fetal alcohol exposure. Upon fetal alcohol exposure, HSF2 is essential for the triggering of HSF1 activation, which is accompanied by distinctive post-translational modifications, and HSF2 steers the formation of atypical alcohol-specific HSF1-HSF2 heterocomplexes. This perturbs the in vivo binding of HSF2 to heat shock elements (HSEs) in genes that control neuronal migration in normal conditions, such as p35 or the MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins, such as Dclk1 and Dcx), and alters their expression. In the absence of HSF2, migration defects as well as alterations in gene expression are reduced. Thus, HSF2, as a sensor for alcohol stress in the fetal brain, acts as a mediator of the neuronal migration defects associated with FASD. © 2014 The Authors.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

We examined the effects of AEDs on behavioral characteristics and cognitive development among school age children born to women with epilepsy. Methods: Children aged 6-15 years and born to women with epilepsy were enrolled in the study. Information was collected on the women's demographics and the details of their usage/ non-usage of AEDs during pregnancy. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for the Children-Revised (WICS-R) test was administered to the children. The Alexander IQ test and the Conner Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) were administered to the mothers. Comparisons were made between children who had been exposed and not exposed to AEDs in utero and if exposed, according to exposure to AED monotherapy or polytherapy. The mother's education level and IQ score and data from the same parent's siblings were evaluated with respect to consanguinity. Results: Forty-one children born to 28 women with epilepsy were enrolled. Seven mothers had multiple pregnancies. Twenty-three pregnancies (56%) were exposed to monotherapy and five (12.1%) to polytherapy. The remaining 13 (31.7%) were not exposed to AEDs. Maternal education level was a significant major factor in child IQ development (P < 0.05). The performance IQ-coding scale results were lower in children exposed to polytherapy than in children exposed to monotherapy in utero (P < 0.05). Although it is difficult to assert with confidence, the sibling assessment indicated a negative effect of valproate on IQ.

K.; Shirasaka, T.","Alcohol is a well-established teratogen that can cause variable physical and behavioral effects on the fetus. The most severe condition in this spectrum of diseases is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). The differences in maternal and fetal enzymes, in terms of abundance and efficiency, in addition to reduced elimination, allow for alcohol to have a prolonged effect on the fetus. This can act as a teratogen through numerous methods including reactive oxygen species (generated as by products of CYP2E1), decreased endogenous antioxidant levels, mitochondrial damage, lipid peroxidation, disrupted neuronal cell-cell adhesion, placental vasoconstriction, and inhibition of cofactors required for fetal growth and development. More recently, alcohol has also been shown to have epigenetic effects. Increased fetal exposure to alcohol and sustained alcohol intake during any trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of FAS. Other risk factors include genetic influences, maternal characteristics, for example, lower socioeconomic statuses and smoking, and paternal chronic alcohol use. The treatment options for FAS have recently started to be explored although none are currently approved clinically. These include prenatal antioxidant administration food supplements, folic acid, choline, neuroactive peptides, and neurotrophic growth factors. Tackling the wider impacts of FAS, such as comorbidities, and the family system have been shown to improve the quality of life of FAS patients.

A.","INTRODUCTION: In experimental models, prenatal cocaine exposure has been found to perturb GABA and dopamine development. Clinically, abnormalities in tone, posture and state regulation are noted in early infancy but the evolution of these findings over time is not well described. The current study assesses the longitudinal effects of prenatal cocaine exposure in dose-dependent fashion on developmental & behavioral and neurological trajectories over the first 2 years of life.
METHODS: Three hundred and eighty infants, 113 cocaine-exposed, were enrolled at birth from an urban hospital from 2000 to 2004. Exposure was determined by maternal interview, segmental hair analyses (RIAH<sup> TM</sup>) in all, and meconium and urine in a subset. Developmental, behavioral and neurological assessments were carried out blind to drug exposure at 6, 12 and 24 months of age in the 306 children who returned in follow-up. Mixed-effects linear modeling (developmental growth curve) assessed change in outcome over time.
RESULTS: The mental developmental growth curve showed a negative slope (2.2 points) in adjusted analyses among cocaine-exposed children over the first 2 years of life. (p=.04), while the slope of the motor development growth curve did not. Adjusting for microcephaly at 6 months diminished the strength of the association between cocaine exposure and mental developmental growth curve (effect modification). Cocaine exposure was marginally associated with behavioral outcomes in adjusted analyses. Total Behavior scores and Orientation/Engagement scores improved with age. At 1 year of age, prenatal cocaine exposure was significantly associated with lower motor development scores. High rates of hypertonia (global and diparesis) identified at the 6-month visit dropped dramatically in the first 2 years of life: cocaine-exposed children showed a more rapid rate of resolution of hypertonia than unexposed children, with hypertonia improving 2.2 times faster among those with heavy cocaine exposure.
CONCLUSION: We found differences in mental performance over the first 2 years of life associated with prenatal cocaine exposure that was mediated by microcephaly implying that cocaine exerts a sustained teratogenic effect on brain development. Early neurological (hypertonia) and behavioral findings associated with prenatal cocaine exposure improved over time. Hypertonia did not predict long-term development impairments. Conceivably, the transient nature of neurobehavioral manifestations reflects postnatally a tendency towards homeostasis of cocaine-related embryopathic perturbations of GABA and dopaminergic systems.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

However, the temporal and regional specificity of such changes and their behavioural consequences are less known. Here we explore the integrity of regional white matter microstructure in infants with in utero exposure to alcohol, shortly after birth.
METHODS: Twenty-eight alcohol-exposed and 28 healthy unexposed infants were imaged using diffusion tensor imaging sequences to evaluate white matter integrity using validated tract-based spatial statistics analysis methods. Second, diffusion values were extracted for group comparisons by regions of interest. Differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD) and radial diffusivity were compared between groups and associations with measures from the Dubowitz neonatal neurobehavioural assessment were examined.
RESULTS: Lower AD values (p<0.05) were observed in alcohol-exposed infants in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus compared with non-exposed infants. Altered FA and MD values in alcohol-exposed neonates in the right inferior cerebellar were associated with abnormal neonatal neurobehaviour.
CONCLUSION: These exploratory data suggest that prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with reduced white matter microstructural integrity even early in the neonatal period. The association with clinical measures reinforces the likely clinical significance of this finding. The location of the findings is remarkably consistent with previously reported studies of white matter structural deficits in older children with a diagnosis of foetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

While early evidence suggests altered functional brain connectivity in the lateralization of motor networks in school-age children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE), the specific effects of alcohol exposure on the establishment of intrinsic connectivity in early infancy have not been explored. Method(s): Sixty subjects received functional imaging at 2 to 4 weeks of age for 6 to 8 minutes during quiet natural sleep. Thirteen alcohol-exposed (PAE) and 14 age-matched control (CTRL) participants with usable data were included in a multivariate model of connectivity between sensorimotor intrinsic functional connectivity networks. Seed-based analyses of group differences in interhemispheric connectivity of intrinsic motor networks were also conducted. The Dubowitz neurological assessment was performed at the imaging visit. Result(s): Alcohol exposure was associated with significant increases in connectivity between somatosensory, motor networks, brainstem/thalamic, and striatal intrinsic networks. Reductions in interhemispheric connectivity of motor and somatosensory networks did not reach significance.

A.; Black, M. M.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Previous research found that prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) may increase children's vulnerability to behavior and cognition problems. Maturational changes in brain and social development make adolescence an ideal time to reexamine associations. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of published studies examining associations between PCE and adolescent development (behavior, cognition/school outcomes, physiologic responses, and brain morphology/functioning).
METHODS: Articles were obtained from PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and CINAHL databases through July 2012 with search terms: prenatal drug, substance, or cocaine exposure; adolescence/adolescent; and in utero substance/drug exposure. Criteria for inclusion were nonexposed comparison group, human adolescents aged 11 to 19, peer-reviewed, English-language, and adolescent outcomes.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies representing 9 cohorts met the criteria. Four outcome categories were identified: behavior, cognition/school performance, brain structure/function, and physiologic responses. Eleven examined behavior; 7 found small but significant differences favoring nonexposed adolescents, with small effect sizes. Eight examined cognition/school performance; 6 reported significantly lower scores on language and memory tasks among adolescents with PCE, with varying effect sizes varied. Eight examined brain structure/function and reported morphologic differences with few functional differences. Three examined physiologic responses with discordant findings. Most studies controlled for other prenatal exposures, caregiving environment, and violence exposure; few examined mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings among younger children, PCE increases the risk for small but significantly less favorable adolescent functioning. Although the clinical importance of differences is often unknown, the caregiving environment and violence exposure pose additional threats. Future research should investigate mechanisms linking PCE with adolescent functioning.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

M.","Stress and glucocorticoid hormones regulate hippocampal neurogenesis, but the molecular mechanisms underlying their effects are unknown. We, therefore, investigated the molecular signaling pathways mediating the effects of cortisol on proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and astrogliogenesis, in an immortalized human hippocampal progenitor cell line. In addition, we examined the molecular signaling pathways activated in the hippocampus of prenatally stressed rats, characterized by persistently elevated glucocorticoid levels in adulthood. In human hippocampal progenitor cells, we found that low concentrations of cortisol (100 nM) increased proliferation (+16%), decreased neurogenesis into microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive neurons (-24%) and doublecortin (Dcx)-positive neuroblasts (-21%), and increased differentiation into S100beta-positive astrocytes (+23%). These effects were dependent on the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) as they were abolished by the MR antagonist, spironolactone, and mimicked by the MR-agonist, aldosterone. In contrast, high concentrations of cortisol (100 muM) decreased proliferation (-17%) and neuronal differentiation into MAP2-positive neurons (-22%) and into Dcx-positive neuroblasts (-27%), without regulating astrogliogenesis. These effects were dependent on the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), blocked by the GR antagonist RU486, and mimicked by the GR-agonist, dexamethasone. Gene expression microarray and pathway analysis showed that the low concentration of cortisol enhances Notch/Hes-signaling, the high concentration inhibits TGFbeta-SMAD2/3-signaling, and both concentrations inhibit Hedgehog signaling. Mechanistically, we show that reduced Hedgehog signaling indeed critically contributes to the cortisol-induced reduction in neuronal differentiation. Accordingly, TGFbeta-SMAD2/3 and Hedgehog signaling were also inhibited in the hippocampus of adult prenatally stressed rats with high glucocorticoid levels. In conclusion, our data demonstrate novel molecular signaling pathways that are regulated by glucocorticoids in vitro, in human hippocampal progenitor cells, and by stress in vivo, in the rat hippocampus. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Behavioral EBC studies in adults with alcohol use disorders and in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders report a clear learning deficit in these two patient populations, suggesting alcohol-related damage to the cerebellum and associated structures. Insight into the neural mechanisms underlying these learning impairments has largely stemmed from laboratory animal studies.

R.","Prenatal alcohol exposure can cause a wide range of deficits in executive function that persist throughout life, but little is known about how changes in brain structure relate to cognition in affected individuals. In the current study, we predicted that the rate of white matter volumetric development would be atypical in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) when compared to typically developing children, and that the rate of change in cognitive function would relate to differential white matter development between groups. Data were available for 103 subjects [49 with FASD, 54 controls, age range 6-17, mean age = 11.83] with 153 total observations. Groups were age-matched. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an executive function (EF) battery. Using white matter volumes measured bilaterally for frontal and parietal regions and the corpus callosum, change was predicted by modeling the effects of age, intracranial volume, sex, and interactions with exposure status and EF measures. While both groups showed regional increases in white matter volumes and improvement in cognitive performance over time, there were significant effects of exposure status on age-related relationships between white matter increases and EF measures. Specifically, individuals with FASD consistently showed a positive relationship between improved cognitive function and increased white matter volume over time, while no such relationships were seen in controls. These novel results relating improved cognitive function with increased white matter volume in FASD suggest that better cognitive outcomes could be possible for FASD subjects through interventions that enhance white matter plasticity. © 2014 The Authors.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

An automated method was applied to 3D T1-weighted images to assess cortical gyrification using global and regional sulcal indices and two region-based morphological measurements, mean sulcal depth and fold opening. Increasing levels of alcohol exposure were related to reduced cortical folding complexity, even among children with normal brain size, indicating a reduction of buried cortical surface. Fold opening was the strongest anatomical correlate of prenatal alcohol intake, indicating a widening of sulci in all regions that were examined.

From 1997-2001, women working in greenhouse horticultures were recruited at the beginning of their pregnancy. Based on detailed interview of the women and their employers, those categorized as occupationally exposed to pesticides were moved to unexposed work functions or went on paid leave, while women without any exposure were considered unexposed controls. Of the resulting birth cohort of 203 children, 133 (65%) were examined at age 6 to 11 years together with 44 newly recruited children of same age whose mothers were not occupationally exposed to pesticides in pregnancy. All children underwent a standardized examination including a battery of neurodevelopmental tests. Maternal occupational pesticide exposure in early pregnancy was associated with prolonged brainstem auditory evoked potential latencies in the children as a whole and with impaired neuropsychological function in girls, while no effect was apparent in boys. In girls, language and motor speed functions were significantly inversely associated with prenatal exposure, and a non-significant tendency toward decreased function was also seen for other neuropsychological outcomes. A structural equation model that combined all these test results showed an overall impaired neuropsychological function in girls prenatally exposed to pesticides. Thus, our findings suggest an adverse effect of maternal occupational pesticide exposure on their children's neurodevelopment, despite the fact that the exposures occurred solely during early pregnancy and under well regulated working conditions, where special measures to protect pregnant women were applied.

P.; Romero, A. M.; Timoneda, J.; Ponsoda, X.; Ballestin, R.; Renau-Piqueras, J.","Aims: Ethanol affects not only the cytoskeletal organization and activity, but also intracellular trafficking in neurons in the primary culture. Polyphosphoinositide (PPIn) are essential regulators of many important cell functions, including those mentioned, cytoskeleton integrity and intracellular vesicle trafficking. Since information about the effect of chronic ethanol exposure on PPIn metabolism in neurons is scarce, this study analysed the effect of this treatment on three of these phospholipids. Methods: Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) levels as well as the activity and/or levels of enzymes involved in their metabolism were analysed in neurons chronically exposed to ethanol. The levels of phospholipases C and D, and phosphatidylethanol formation were also assessed. The consequence of the possible alterations in the levels of PtdIns on the Golgi complex (GC) was also analysed. Results: We show that phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate levels, both involved in the control of intracellular trafficking and cytoskeleton organization, decrease in ethanol-exposed hippocampal neurons. In contrast, several kinases that participate in the metabolism of these phospholipids, and the level and/or activity of phospholipases C and D, increase in cells after ethanol exposure. Ethanol also promotes phosphatidylethanol formation in neurons, which can result in the suppression of phosphatidic acid synthesis and, therefore, in PPIn biosynthesis. This treatment also lowers the phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate levels, the main PPIn in the GC, with alterations in their morphology and in the levels of some of the proteins involved in structure maintenance. Conclusions: The deregulation of the metabolism of PtdIns may underlie the ethanol-induced alterations on different neuronal processes, including intracellular trafficking and cytoskeletal integrity.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

Some authors believe that clinical heterogeneity results from the complex interplay of the many genetic and environmental factors that themselves define a condition as multifactorial. However, it is important to note that neuropathological findings in both idiopathic and syndromic autism suggests a single pathophysiological mechanism acting during brain development: the heterochronic division of germinal cells and subsequent migrational abnormalities of daughter cells to their target fields. Multiple exogenous (e.g., viruses, drugs) and endogenous (e.g., genetic mutations) factors are known to disrupt the division of germinal cells and provide for an autism phenotype. The variety of endogenous and exogenous factors, their timing of action during brain development, and the genetic susceptibility of affected individuals (a Triple Hit hypothesis) may all account for the clinical heterogeneity of ASD.

Q.","Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) are currently under investigation as a candidate treatment for central nervous system (CNS) injury because of their potential to compensate for neuronal damage and to reconstruct disrupted neuronal connections. To maximize the regenerative effect of the derived neurons and to minimize the side effects of the derived astrocytes, it is necessary to regulate the fate determination of NSCs to produce more neurons and fewer astrocytes. Both valproic acid (VPA) and all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), two clinically established drugs, induce neuronal differentiation and facilitate neurite outgrowth at the expense of astrocytic differentiation in NSCs. However, the time-dependent activities and the long-term treatment effects of these drugs have not been explored in NSCs. More importantly, the efficacies of VPA and ATRA in neuronal promotion and astrocytic suppression remain unclear. In this study, we compare the time-dependent characteristics of VPA and ATRA in NSC differentiation and neurite outgrowth in vitro and, for the first time, demonstrate the improved efficacy of their combined application in neuronal induction and astrocrtic suppression. These significant effects are closely coupled to the altered expression of a neurogenic transcription factor, a Wnt signaling component, a cell cycle regulator and a neural growth factor, indicating an underlying cross-talk between the mechanisms of action of ATRA and VPA. These findings indicate that a novel strategy combining these two therapeutic drugs may improve the restorative effect of NSC transplantation by altering the expression of their interconnected targets for fate determination.

M.; Daskalopoulou, A.; Misitzi, A.; Batsidis, E.; Bakoyiannis, I.; Pergialiotis, V.","It is estimated that approximately 0.5%-3% of fetuses are prenatally exposed to cocaine (COC). The neurodevelopmental implications of this exposure are numerous and include motor skill impairments, alterations of social function, predisposition to anxiety, and memory function and attention deficits; these implications are commonly observed in experimental studies and ultimately affect both learning and IQ. According to previous studies, the clinical manifestations of prenatal COC exposure seem to persist at least until adolescence. The pathophysiological cellular processes that underlie these impairments include dysfunctional myelination, disrupted dendritic architecture, and synaptic alterations. On a molecular level, various neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, catecholamines, and gamma-aminobutyric acid seem to participate in this process. Finally, prenatal COC abuse has been also associated with functional changes in the hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis that mediate neuroendocrine responses. The purpose of this review is to summarize the neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal COC abuse, to describe the pathophysiological pathways that underlie these consequences, and to provide implications for future research in the field.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

C.","The benefit of the nutritious elements in fish is insufficient for explaining the controversial finding regarding prenatal mercury (Hg) exposure and neurodevelopment; the varying frequency of susceptible genes among these populations may shed light on these observations. However, limited studies have been reported on the association between genetic susceptibility of prenatal Hg exposure and child development. Apolipoprotein E (APOE, protein; Apoe, gene) is a major protein transporter expressed in the brain. The Apoe epsilon 4 (epsilon 4) allele is associated with poor neural repair function and is a risk factor associated with Alzheimer disease. We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2004 and 2005. In this study, 168 subjects were recruited at delivery and followed up at two years of age, and genetic polymorphisms of Apoe were included to assess genetic susceptibility and to determine the relationship between Hg concentrations in cord blood and neurodevelopment. The results showed that adverse effects on neurodevelopment were consistently associated with prenatal Hg exposure in all subtests of Comprehensive Developmental Inventory for Infants and Toddlers (CDIIT) among epsilon 4 carriers as assessed by both simple linear and multiple linear regression models. After controlling for confounding factors, statistical significance was found in the subtests of cognition tests (beta = -8.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -16.10 to -0.84), social tests (beta = -11.02, 95% CI = -20.85 to -1.19) and the whole test of CDIIT (beta = -10.45, 95% CI = -17.36 to -3.54) in a multiple linear regression model. Additionally, the interaction effect between gene polymorphisms of Apoe and Hg levels was significant in the whole. test CDIIT and subtests of cognition, language and fine motor tests. In conclusion, Apoe modifies the adverse effects of cord blood Hg on neurodevelopment at the age of two years. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Method: Children who were exposed to cocaine in utero (PCE; n = 183) and children who were not exposed to cocaine (i.e., no cocaine exposure [NCE]; n = 181) were followed prospectively from birth to 12 years of age and were compared on language subtests of the Test of Language Development-Intermediate, Third Edition (Hammill & Newcomer, 1997b), and phonological processing as measured by the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (Wagner & Torgesen, 1999). The authors evaluated the relationship of PCE to language development through a multivariate analysis of covariance and regression analyses while controlling for confounders. Results: Results show that PCE has small effects on specific aspects of language, including syntax and phonological processing. The caregiver variables of lower maternal vocabulary, more psychological symptoms, and a poorer home environment also had consistent effects on language and phonological processing scores. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PCE continues to have small, subtle effects on specific aspects of language at age 12 years. Phonological processing skills were significantly related to the reading outcomes of letter-word identification, reading fluency, and reading comprehension, indicating that PCE also has small but lasting effects on the language skills that are related to later literacy skills.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

We aim to examine whether prenatal GC exposure programs long-term mental health in humans. Method(s): Using propensity-score-matching, children prenatally exposed to synthetic glucocorticoids (sGC), n=37, and controls, n=185, were balanced on important confounders related to sGC treatment - gestational age and prepregnancy BMI. We also used mixed-effects modeling to analyse the entire cohort - matching each sGC case, n=37, to all possible controls, n=6079, on gestational age and sex. We obtained data from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 at four waves - pregnancy, birth, 8 and 16 years. Data on pregnancy and birth outcomes came from medical records. Mental health was assessed at 8 years by teachers with the Rutter B2 scale, and at 16 years by parents with the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and Normal behavior (SWAN) scale and adolescents by the Youth Self-Report (YSR) scale. Result(s): Prenatal sGC treatment was consistently associated with adverse mental health in childhood and adolescence, as shown by both the propensity-score method and mixed-effects model. Using the propensity-score-matched subsample, linear multiple regression showed prenatal sGC was significantly linked with general psychiatric disturbance (B=8.34 [95% CI: .23-16.45]) and inattention (B= .97 [95% CI: .16-1.80]) at 8 years after control for relevant confounders. Similar findings were obtained at 16 years, but did not reach statistical significance. Mediation by birthweight/placental weight was not detected. Conclusion(s): This study is the first to prospectively investigate the long-term associations between prenatal exposure to sGC treatment and mental health in children and adolescents.

More recently, the involvement of several other molecular pathways was explored, including non-coding RNA, epigenetic changes and specific vitamin deficiencies. These various pathways may interact, producing a wide spectrum of consequences. Detailed understanding of these various pathways and their interactions will facilitate the therapeutic target identification, leading to new clinical intervention, which may reduce the incidence and severity of these highly prevalent preventable birth defects.

L.; O'Brien, J. W.; Spadoni, A. D.; Tapert, S. F.; Jones, K. L.; Riley, E. P.; Mattson, S. N.","Background: Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure leads to widespread cognitive deficits, including problems with spatial working memory (SWM). Neuroimaging studies report structural and functional abnormalities in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), but interpretations may be complicated by the co-occurrence of a family history of alcoholism. Since this history is also linked to cognitive deficits and brain abnormalities, it is difficult to determine the extent to which deficits are unique to prenatal alcohol exposure. Method(s): Age-matched subjects selected from 2 neuroimaging studies underwent functional imaging while engaging in a task assessing memory for spatial locations relative to a vigilance condition assessing attention. Pairwise comparisons were made for the following 3 groups: children with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (ALC, n = 18); those with no prenatal alcohol exposure, but a confirmed family history of alcoholism (FHP, n = 18); and nonexposed, family history negative controls (CON, n = 17). Result(s): Relative to CON and FHP, the ALC group showed increased blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the left middle and superior frontal gyri for the SWM condition relative to the vigilance condition (SWM contrast). Additionally, the ALC group showed unique BOLD response increases in the left lingual gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus relative to CON, and left cuneus and precuneus relative to FHP. Both ALC and FHP showed greater activation compared to CON in the lentiform nucleus and insular region. Conclusion(s): These results confirm previous studies suggesting SWM deficits in FASD. Differences between the ALC group and the CON and FHP groups suggest the left middle and superior frontal region may be specifically affected in alcohol-exposed children. Conversely, differences from the CON group in the lentiform nucleus and insular region for the ALC and FHP groups may indicate this region is associated with family history of alcoholism rather than specifically with prenatal alcohol exposure. © 2012 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

In addition, ASD is often an important clinical presentation of some well-known genetic syndromes in human. We discuss these syndromes as well as the role of the more important prenatal factors affecting the fetus throughout pregnancy which may also be associated with ASD. Among the genetic disorders we find Fragile X, Rett syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Timothy syndrome, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, Hamartoma tumor syndrome, Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, and a few others. Among the maternal diseases in pregnancy associated with ASD are diabetes mellitus (PGDM and/or GDM), some maternal autoimmune diseases like antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) with anti-beta2GP1 IgG antibodies and thyroid disease with anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, preeclampsia and some other autoimmune diseases with IgG antibodies that might affect fetal brain development. Other related factors are maternal infections (rubella and CMV with fetal brain injuries, and possibly Influenza with fever), prolonged fever and maternal inflammation, especially with changes in a variety of inflammatory cytokines and antibodies that cross the placenta and affect the fetal brain. Among the drugs are valproic acid, thalidomide, misoprostol, and possibly SSRIs. beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists and paracetamol have also lately been associated with increased rate of ASD but the data is too preliminary and inconclusive. Associations were also described with ethanol, cocaine, and possibly heavy metals, heavy smoking, and folic acid deficiency. Recent studies show that heavy exposure to pesticides and air pollution, especially particulate matter < 2.5 and 10 mum in diameter (PM2.5 and PM10) during pregnancy is also associated with ASD. Finally, we have to remember that many of the associations mentioned in this review are only partially proven, and not all are ""clean"" of different confounding factors. The associations described in this review emphasize again how little we know about the etiology and pathogenesis of ASD.

Less clear is how regional brain tissue reductions differ after normalizing for brain size differences linked with FASD and whether these profiles can predict the degree of prenatal exposure to alcohol. To examine associations of regional brain tissue excesses/deficits with degree of prenatal alcohol exposure and diagnosis with and without correction for overall brain volume, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) methods were applied to structural imaging data from a well-characterized, demographically homogeneous sample of children diagnosed with FASD (n = 39, 9.6-11.0 years) and controls (n = 16, 9.5-11.0 years). Degree of prenatal alcohol exposure was significantly associated with regionally pervasive brain tissue reductions in: (1) the thalamus, midbrain, and ventromedial frontal lobe, (2) the superior cerebellum and inferior occipital lobe, (3) the dorsolateral frontal cortex, and (4) the precuneus and superior parietal lobule. When overall brain size was factored out of the analysis on a subject-by-subject basis, no regions showed significant associations with alcohol exposure. FASD diagnosis was associated with a similar deformation pattern, but few of the regions survived FDR correction. In data-driven independent component analyses (ICA) regional brain tissue deformations successfully distinguished individuals based on extent of prenatal alcohol exposure and to a lesser degree, diagnosis. The greater sensitivity of the continuous measure of alcohol exposure compared with the categorical diagnosis across diverse brain regions underscores the dose dependence of these effects. The ICA results illustrate that profiles of brain tissue alterations may be a useful indicator of prenatal alcohol exposure when reliable historical data are not available and facial features are not apparent.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

J.","Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are characterized by aberrant and delayed early-life development of the brain, leading to deficits in language, cognition, motor behaviour and other functional domains, often accompanied by somatic symptoms. Environmental factors like perinatal infection, malnutrition and trauma can increase the risk of the heterogeneous, multifactorial and polygenic disorders, autism and schizophrenia. Conversely, discrete genetic anomalies are involved in Down, Rett and Fragile X syndromes, tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, the less familiar Phelan-McDermid, Sotos, Kleefstra, Coffin-Lowry and ""ATRX"" syndromes, and the disorders of imprinting, Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes. NDDs have been termed "" synaptopathies"" in reference to structural and functional disturbance of synaptic plasticity, several involve abnormal Ras-Kinase signalling (""rasopathies""), and many are characterized by disrupted cerebral connectivity and an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission. However, at a different level of integration, NDDs are accompanied by aberrant ""epigenetic"" regulation of processes critical for normal and orderly development of the brain. Epigenetics refers to potentially-heritable (by mitosis and/or meiosis) mechanisms controlling gene expression without changes in DNA sequence. In certain NDDs, prototypical epigenetic processes of DNA methylation and covalent histone marking are impacted. Conversely, others involve anomalies in chromatin-modelling, mRNA splicing/editing, mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis and/or the regulatory actions of small nucleolar RNAs and micro-RNAs. Since epigenetic mechanisms are modifiable, this raises the hope of novel therapy, though questions remain concerning efficacy and safety. The above issues are critically surveyed in this review, which advocates a broad-based epigenetic framework for understanding and ultimately treating a diverse assemblage of NDDs (""epigenopathies"") lying at the interface of genetic, developmental and environmental processes.

R.; Zachariah, R. M.; Davie, J. R.; Rastegar, M.","Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) is an important epigenetic factor in the brain. MeCP2 expression is affected by different environmental insults including alcohol exposure. Accumulating evidence supports the role of aberrant MeCP2 expression in ethanol exposure-induced neurological symptoms. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of ethanol-induced MeCP2 deregulation remain elusive. To study the effect of ethanol on Mecp2/MeCP2 expression during neurodifferentiation, we established an in vitro model of ethanol exposure, using differentiating embryonic brain-derived neural stem cells (NSC). Previously, we demonstrated the impact of DNA methylation at the Mecp2 regulatory elements (REs) on Mecp2/MeCP2 expression in vitro and in vivo. Here, we studied whether altered DNA methylation at these REs is associated with the Mecp2/MeCP2 misexpression induced by ethanol. Binge-like and continuous ethanol exposure upregulated Mecp2/MeCP2, while ethanol withdrawal downregulated its expression. DNA methylation analysis by methylated DNA immunoprecipitation indicated that increased 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and decreased 5-methylcytosine (5mC) enrichment at specific REs were associated with upregulated Mecp2/MeCP2 following continuous ethanol exposure. The reduced Mecp2/MeCP2 expression upon ethanol withdrawal was associated with reduced 5hmC and increased 5mC enrichment at these REs. Moreover, ethanol altered global DNA methylation (5mC and 5hmC). Under the tested conditions, ethanol had minimal effects on NSC cell fate commitment, but caused changes in neuronal morphology and glial cell size. Taken together, our data represent an epigenetic mechanism for ethanol-mediated misexpression of Mecp2/MeCP2 in differentiating embryonic brain cells.

This article aims at evaluating the impact of exposure to several chemicals including: organophosphate, organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), mercury and lead on the neurodevelopment of children by reviewing the most recent published literature, and answer the question whether any progress has been made in the epidemiology of the neurodevelopment of children induced by exposure to those chemicals. The result of the presented studies show that exposure to the above-mentioned chemicals may impair the neurodevelopment of children. Neonates exposed to organophosphate pesticides demonstrated a higher proportion of abnormal reflexes, and young children had more attention problems. Exposure to organochlorine pesticides in children was associated with alertness, quality of alert responsiveness, cost of attention and other potential attention associated measures. The majority of studies indicate the negative impact of lead exposure at the level <10 microg/dl or even <5 microg/dl on the neurodevelopment of children. The results of studies on exposure to PCBs, mercury, and their effect on neurodevelopment are inconsistent. Some suggest that prenatal exposure to PCBs and mercury is related to performance impairments, attention and concentration problems, while other do not present any statistically significant association. The studies were mostly well designed, using prospective cohorts with the exposure assessment based on the biomarker of exposure. Concerning the covariates and confounders affecting the endpoints in most of the presented studies, confounders were included in data analysis. In order to recognize the early cognitive, motor and language outcomes of chemical exposures, well standardized tools were used for evaluating the neurodevelopmental effects and offer an early and fairly comprehensive measure of child development.

M.; Meyer-Lindenberg, A.; Banaschewski, T.; Brandeis, D.; Laucht, M.","IMPORTANCE: There is accumulating evidence relating maternal smoking during pregnancy to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) without elucidating specific mechanisms. Research investigating the neurobiological underpinnings of this disorder has implicated deficits during response inhibition. Attempts to uncover the effect of prenatal exposure to nicotine on inhibitory control may thus be of high clinical importance.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the influence of maternal smoking during pregnancy (hereafter referred to as prenatal smoking) on the neural circuitry of response inhibition and its association with related behavioral phenotypes such as ADHD and novelty seeking in the mother's offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the offspring at 25 years of age during a modified Eriksen flanker/NoGo task, and voxel-based morphometry was performed to study brain volume differences of the offspring. Prenatal smoking (1-5 cigarettes per day [14 mothers] or >5 cigarettes per day [24 mothers]) and lifetime ADHD symptoms were determined using standardized parent interviews at the offspring's age of 3 months and over a period of 13 years (from 2 to 15 years of age), respectively. Novelty seeking was assessed at 19 years of age. Analyses were adjusted for sex, parental postnatal smoking, psychosocial and obstetric adversity, maternal prenatal stress, and lifetime substance abuse. A total of 178 young adults (73 males) without current psychopathology from a community sample followed since birth (Mannheim, Germany) participated in the study.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Functional magnetic resonance imaging response, morphometric data, lifetime ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking.
RESULTS: Participants prenatally exposed to nicotine exhibited a weaker response in the anterior cingulate cortex (t168 = 4.46; peak Montreal Neurological Institute [MNI] coordinates x = -2, y = 20, z = 30; familywise error [FWE]-corrected P = .003), the right inferior frontal gyrus (t168 = 3.65; peak MNI coordinates x = 44, y = 38, z = 12; FWE-corrected P = .04), the left inferior frontal gyrus (t168 = 4.09; peak MNI coordinates x = -38, y = 36, z = 8; FWE-corrected P = .009), and the supramarginal gyrus (t168 = 5.03; peak MNI coordinates x = 64, y = -28, z = 22; FWE-corrected P = .02) during the processing of the NoGo compared to neutral stimuli, while presenting a decreased volume in the right inferior frontal gyrus. These findings were obtained irrespective of the adjustment of confounders, ADHD symptoms, and novelty seeking. There was an inverse relationship between inferior frontal gyrus activity and ADHD symptoms and between anterior cingulate cortex activity and novelty seeking.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings point to a functional involvement of prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke in neural alterations similar to ADHD, which underlines the importance of smoking prevention treatments.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

Ten percent of safety-related late-stage clinical failures are due to neurological side effects. Animal models are poor in predicting human neurotoxicity due to interspecies differences and most in vitro assays cannot distinguish neurotoxicity from general cytotoxicity for chemotherapeutics. We developed in vitro assays capable of quantifying the paediatric neurotoxic potential for cytotoxic drugs. Mixed cultures of human fetal brain cells were differentiated in monolayers and as 3D-neurospheres in the presence of non-neurotoxic chemotherapeutics (etoposide, teniposide) or neurotoxicants (methylmercury). The cytotoxic potency towards dividing progenitors versus differentiated neurons and astrocytes was compared using: (1) immunohistochemistry staining and cell counts in monolayers; (2) through quantitative Western blots in neurospheres; and (3) neurosphere migration assays. Etoposide and teniposide, were 5-10 times less toxic to differentiated neurons compared to the mix of all cells in monolayer cultures. In contrast, the neurotoxicant methylmercury did not exhibit selectivity and killed all cells with the same potency.

For each subject, the MEG signal was recorded for 60 s during rest while subjects lay supine. Using time series analysis, we calculated the synchronous neural interactions for all pair-wise combinations of 248 MEG sensors resulting in 30,628 partial correlations for each subject.

J.; Bartell, S. M.; Hansen, R. L.; Barfod, G. H.; Green, P. G.; Hertz-Picciotto, I.","BACKGROUND: Methylmercury (MeHg), known for well over a century as a neurotoxin in adults, has more recently been studied for potential detrimental effects during early brain development. While several studies have estimated mercury exposure, they usually rely on either a single biomarker or questionnaire data, each of which has limitations. The goal of this paper was to develop a toxicokinetic model that incorporates both biomarker and questionnaire data to estimate the cumulative exposure to MeHg through seafood consumption using data collected from the Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment (CHARGE) study.
METHODS: We utilized a previously described discrete-time model that estimates blood MeHg concentration given a piecewise-constant ingestion rate and single-compartment pharmacokinetics. We measured newborn bloodspot Hg concentrations and obtained information pertaining to maternal fish consumption using a questionnaire. Using MeHg concentration estimates from the toxicokinetic model, cumulative MeHg exposure was estimated in children with autism, children with developmental delay, and typically developing children. Median estimated cumulative MeHg was compared among diagnostic groups using the Kruskal-Wallis Test. Multinomial logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between cumulative MeHg concentration and the risk of autism and developmental delay (vs. typical development).
RESULTS: The estimated average MeHg concentration of for all fish species consumed by mothers was 42 ppb. Median cumulative MeHg over gestation was similar across diagnostic groups (p-values raged from 0.91 to 0.98). After adjusting for potential confounding, we found no association between cumulative MeHg exposure and the risk of autism (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.12) or developmental delay (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.89, 1.13).
CONCLUSIONS: The toxicokinetic model described in this paper yielded fish MeHg concentration estimates that are consistent with fish species containing lower levels of MeHg. Overall, cumulative MeHg exposure does not appear to detectably elevate the risk of autism or developmental delay. Based on the regression standard error for the association between ASD and TD, we would have reported statistical significance for an adjusted odds ratio of 1.09 or larger. This method can easily be extended to other epidemiologic studies in which there is a biomarker measurement and questionnaire data regarding exposure.",,0,WP2,WP3,WP4

The environmental contaminant, methylmercury (MeHg), impairs neural development with effects that are manifested well into adulthood and even into aging. Noting the sensitivity of the developing brain to MeHg, the current review advances an argument that one outcome of early MeHg exposure is a distortion in the processing of reinforcing consequences that results in impaired choice, poor inhibition of prepotent responding, and perseveration on discrimination reversals (in the absence of alteration of extradimensional shifts). Neurochemical correlates include increased sensitivity to dopamine agonists and decreased sensitivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists. This leads to a hypothesis that the prefrontal cortex or dopamine neurotransmission is especially sensitive to even subtle gestational MeHg exposure and suggests that public health assessments of MeHg based on intellectual performance may underestimate the impact of MeHg in public health.

There is evidence that the majority of children in Hong Kong exceed this level as a result of high fish consumption of mothers during pregnancy. Objective: To study whether there are any associations between low-dose prenatal methylmercury exposure and neurocognitive outcomes in Hong Kong children. Materials and methods: All 1057 children from the original birth cohort were eligible for entry into the study, except children with conditions that would affect neurocognitive development, but were unrelated to methylmercury exposure. Subjects were assessed by a wide panel of tests covering a broad range of neurocognitive functions: Hong Kong Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (HK-WISC), Hong Kong List Learning Test (HKLLT), Tests of Everyday Attention for Children (TEACH), Boston Naming Test, and Grooved Pegboard Test. Results: 608 subjects were recruited (median age 8.2 years, IQR 73, 8.8; 53.9% boys).

METHODS: A subsample (n = 1,311) of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (Bristol, UK) was selected, and mercury (Hg) concentrations were measured in freeze-dried umbilical cord tissue as a measure of MeHg exposure. A total of 1135 children had available data on 247 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within relevant genes, as well as the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children Intelligence Quotient (IQ) scores at age 8 years. Multivariate regression models were used to assess the associations between MeHg exposure and IQ and to determine possible gene-environment interactions.
RESULTS: Hg concentrations indicated low background exposures (mean = 26 ng/g, standard deviation = 13). Log10-transformed Hg was positively associated with IQ, which attenuated after adjustment for nutritional and sociodemographic cofactors. In stratified analyses, a reverse association was found in higher social class families (for performance IQ, P value for interaction = 0.0013) among whom there was a wider range of MeHg exposure. Among 40 SNPs showing nominally significant main effects, MeHg interactions were detected for rs662 (paraoxonase 1) and rs1042838 (progesterone receptor) (P < 0.05) and for rs3811647 (transferrin) and rs2049046 (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) (P < 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population with a low level of MeHg exposure, there were only equivocal associations between MeHg exposure and adverse neuropsychological outcomes. Heterogeneities in several relevant genes suggest possible genetic predisposition to MeHg neurotoxicity in a substantial proportion of the population.

K.; Margolis, A. E.; Tang, C.; Wright, R.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The prevalence of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders has been increasing over the last several decades. Prenatal and early childhood exposure to environmental toxicants is increasingly recognized as contributing to the growing rate of neurodevelopmental disorders. Very little information is known about the mechanistic processes by which environmental chemicals alter brain development. We review the recent advances in brain imaging modalities and discuss their application in epidemiologic studies of prenatal and early childhood exposure to environmental toxicants. RECENT FINDINGS: Neuroimaging techniques (volumetric and functional MRI, diffusor tensor imaging, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy) have opened unprecedented access to study the developing human brain. These techniques are noninvasive and free of ionization radiation making them suitable for research applications in children. Using these techniques, we now understand much about structural and functional patterns in the typically developing brain. This knowledge allows us to investigate how prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants may alter the typical developmental trajectory. SUMMARY: MRI is a powerful tool that allows in-vivo visualization of brain structure and function. Used in epidemiologic studies of environmental exposure, it offers the promise to causally link exposure with behavioral and cognitive manifestations and ultimately to inform programs to reduce exposure and mitigate adverse effects of exposure. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

90172157,https://sysrev.com/p/119552/article/90172157,"Significance of epigenetics for understanding brain development, brain evolution and behaviour",Neuroscience,"Keverne, E. B.","Two major environmental developments have occurred in mammalian evolution which have impacted on the genetic and epigenetic regulation of brain development. The first of these was viviparity and development of the placenta which placed a considerable burden of time and energy investment on the matriline, and which resulted in essential hypothalamic modifications. Maternal feeding, maternal care, parturition, milk letdown and the suspension of fertility and sexual behaviour are all determined by the maternal hypothalamus and have evolved to meet foetal needs under the influence of placental hormones. Viviparity itself provided a new environmental variable for selection pressures to operate via the co-existence over three generations of matrilineal genomes (mother, developing offspring and developing oocytes) in one individual. Also of importance for the matriline has been the evolution of epigenetic marks (imprint control regions) which are heritable and undergo reprogramming primarily in the oocyte to regulate imprinted gene expression according to parent of origin. Imprinting of autosomal genes has played a significant role in mammalian evolutionary development, particularly that of the hypothalamus and placenta. Indeed, many imprinted genes that are co-expressed in the placenta and hypothalamus play an important role in the co-adapted functioning of these organs. Thus the action and interaction of two genomes (maternal and foetal) have provided a template for transgenerational selection pressures to operate in shaping the mothering capabilities of each subsequent generation. The advanced aspects of neocortical brain evolution in primates have emancipated much of behaviour from the determining effects of hormonal action. Thus in large brain primates, most of the sexual behaviour is not reproductive hormone dependent and maternal care can and does occur outside the context of pregnancy and parturition. The neocortex has evolved to be adaptable and while the adapted changes are not inherited, the epigenetic predisposing processes can be. This provides each generation with the same ability to generate new adaptations while retaining a ""cultural"" predisposition to retain others. A significant evolutionary contribution to this epigenetic dimension has again been the matriline. The extensive neocortical development which takes place post-natally does so in an environment which is predominantly that of the caring guidance of the mother. Evidence for the epigenetic regulation of neocortical development is best illustrated by the GABA-ergic neurons and their long tangential migratory pathway from the ganglionic eminence, in contrast to the radial migration of principle neurons. GABA-ergic neurons play an integral role both in the developmental formation of canonical localised circuits and in synchronising widespread functional activity by the regulation of network oscillations. Such synchronisation enables distributed regions of the neocortex to coordinate firing. GABA-ergic dysfunction contributes to a broad spectrum of neurological and psychiatric disorders which can differ even across identical monozygotic twins. Moreover, major treatments for schizophrenia over the past 40 years have included the drugs lithium and valproate, both of which we now know are histone deacetylases. It is rarely the heritable dysfunctioning of these epigenetic mechanisms that is at fault, but the timing, duration and place where they are deployed. The timing and complexity in the development of the neocortex makes this region of the brain more vulnerable to perturbations.",,0,0,0,0

Rev.,"Jaiswal, P.; Mohanakumar, K. P.; Rajamma, U.","Serotonergic system has long been implicated in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), since platelet hyperserotonemia is consistently observed in a subset of autistic patients, who respond well to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Apart from being a neurotransmitter, serotonin functions as a neurotrophic factor directing brain development and as an immunoregulator modulating immune responses. Serotonin transporter (SERT) regulates serotonin level in lymphoid tissues to ensure its proper functioning in innate and adaptive responses. Immunological molecules such as cytokines in turn regulate the transcription and activity of SERT. Dysregulation of serotonergic system could trigger signalling cascades that affect normal neural-immune interactions culminating in neurodevelopmental and neural connectivity defects precipitating behavioural abnormalities, or the disease phenotypes. Therefore, we suggest that a better understanding of the cross talk between serotonergic genes, immune systems and serotonergic neurotransmission will open wider avenues to develop pharmacological leads for addressing the core ASD behavioural deficits.

Single voxel <sup>1</sup>H-MRS data, sampled in parietal white and gray matter, were acquired from 36 neonates exposed to alcohol in utero, and 31 control unexposed healthy neonates, in their 2nd-4th week of life. Metabolites relative to creatine with phosophocreatine and metabolites absolute concentrations using a water reference are reported. Male infants exposed to alcohol in utero were found to have reduced concentration of glutamate with glutamine (Glx) in their parietal white matter (PWM), compared to healthy male infants (p = 0.02). Further, male infants exposed to alcohol in utero had reduced concentration and ratio for glutamate (Glu) in their PWM (p = 0.02), compared to healthy male infants and female infants exposed to alcohol in utero. Female infants showed higher relative Glx and Glu ratios for parietal gray matter (PGM, p < 0.01), compared to male infants. We speculate that the decreased Glx and Glu concentrations in PWM are a result of delayed oligodendrocyte maturation, which may be a result of dysfunctional thyroid hormone activity in males exposed to alcohol in utero.

Dental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) have been shown to differentiate into cell-types of cranial neural crest ontology; however, their ability to differentiate to functional neurons of the central nervous system remains to be studied. We hypothesized that midbrain cues might commit DPSCs to differentiate to functional dopaminergic cell-type. As expected, DPSCs in their naive state spontaneously expressed early and mature neuronal markers like nestin, musashi12, beta tubulin III, and Map2ab. On exposure to midbrain cues (sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 8 and basic fibroblast growth factor), DPSCs showed upregulation of dopaminergic neuron-specific transcription factors Nuclear Receptor related protein 1 (Nurr1), Engrailed 1 (En1) and paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 3 (Pitx3) as revealed by real-time RT-PCR. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analysis showed enhanced expression of mature neuronal marker Map2ab and dopaminergic-neuronal markers [tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), En1, Nurr1, and Pitx3], with nearly 77% of the induced DPSCs positive for TH. Functional studies indicated that the induced DPSCs could secrete dopamine constitutively and upon stimulation with potassium chloride (KCl) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as measured by dopamine ELISA. Additionally, the induced DPSCs showed intracellular Ca(2+) influx in the presence of KCl, unlike control DPSCs. ATP-stimulated Ca(2+) influx was observed in control and induced DPSCs, but only the induced cells secreted dopamine.

H.; Park, H.; Ha, M.; Kim, Y.; Hong, Y. C.; Kim, E. J.; Kim, B. N.","BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the developmental effects of prenatal exposure to Pb and Cd on infant cognitive development at 6 months of age.
METHODS: Between 2006 and 2010, the blood levels of Pb and Cd were measured in 884 mothers during their early and late pregnancy. The mental (MDI) and psychomotor (PDI) development index scores of the infants were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. The development index scores were adjusted for birth weight, maternal age, maternal education level, family income, breastfeeding status, and residential area.
RESULTS: The geometric mean of the maternal blood concentration was 1.36mug/dL (10th percentile=0.83; 90th percentile=2.13; range=0.26-9.10) for Pb and 1.42mug/L (10th percentile=1.01; 90th percentile=2.16; range=0.03-9.87) for Cd during the early pregnancy period and 1.27mug/dL (10th percentile=0.77; 90th percentile=2.10; range=0.12-4.28) for Pb and 1.52mug/L for Cd (10 percentile=1.07; 90th percentile=2.10; range=0.43-3.73) during the late pregnancy period. The prenatal Pb and Cd concentrations during the early pregnancy period showed no association with the adjusted MDI or PDI scores. The antagonistic interaction between the prenatal Pb and Cd levels during the early pregnancy period had a significant effect on the MDI score (B=-4.64, 95% CI=-8.17 to -1.12, p=0.01), but the effect of this interaction did not reach statistical significance for the PDI score (B=-3.69, 95% CI=-7.94 to 0.56, p=0.09). The Pb levels during the late pregnancy period were inversely associated with the MDI score (B=-1.94, 95% CI=-3.60 to -0.29, p=0.02) but not with the PDI score (B=-1.69, 95% CI=-3.65 to 0.27, p=0.09). The prenatal Cd levels during the late pregnancy period showed no association with the MDI or PDI score. However, the MDI score (B=-3.20, 95% CI=-5.35 to -1.06, p<0.01) and the PDI score (B=-2.86, 95% CI=-5.55 to -0.16, p=0.04) of infants with Cd levels >1.51mug/L were significantly associated with the Pb level, whereas there were no such associations for infants with Cd levels <1.51mug/L. These results suggest that there is a synergistic effect modification between Pb and Cd during the late pregnancy period.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that there is dose-dependent interaction between prenatal exposure to Pb and prenatal exposure to Cd. The results further demonstrate the biological complexities of examining the neurodevelopmental effects of co-exposure to multiple toxicants.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

To test whether arsenate affects the viability and the GSH metabolism of brain astrocytes, we have used primary astrocyte cultures as model system. Incubation of astrocytes for 2 h with arsenate in concentrations of up to 10 mM caused an almost linear increase in the cellular arsenic content, but did not acutely compromise cell viability. The presence of moderate concentrations of arsenate caused a time- and concentration-dependent loss of GSH from viable astrocytes which was accompanied by a matching increase in the extracellular GSH content. Half-maximal effects were observed for arsenate in a concentration of about 0.3 mM. The arsenate-induced stimulated GSH export from astrocytes was prevented by MK571, an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance protein 1. Exposure of astrocytes to arsenite increased the specific cellular arsenic content and stimulated GSH export to values that were similar to those observed for arsenate-treated cells, while dimethylarsinic acid was less efficiently accumulated by the cells and did not modulate cellular and extracellular GSH levels. The observed strong stimulation of GSH export from astrocytes by arsenate suggests that disturbances of the astrocytic GSH metabolism may contribute to the observed arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

J.; Singh, U. S.","Ethanol is the main constituent of alcoholic beverages that exerts toxicity to neuronal development. Ethanol affects synaptogenesis and prevents proper brain development. In humans, synaptogenesis takes place during the third trimester of pregnancy, and in rodents this period corresponds to the initial few weeks of postnatal development. In this period neuronal maturation and differentiation begin and neuronal cells start migrating to their ultimate destinations. Although the neuronal development of all areas of the brain is affected, the cerebellum and cerebellar neurons are more susceptible to the damaging effects of ethanol. Ethanol's harmful effects include neuronal cell death, impaired differentiation, reduction of neuronal numbers, and weakening of neuronal plasticity. Neuronal development requires many hormones and growth factors such as retinoic acid, nerve growth factors, and cytokines. These factors regulate development and differentiation of neurons by acting through various receptors and their signaling pathways. Ethanol exposure during development impairs neuronal signaling mechanisms mediated by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the retinoic acid receptors, and by growth factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF).

Rev.,"Veazey, K. J.; Muller, D.; Golding, M. C.","Exposure to alcohol significantly alters the developmental trajectory of progenitor cells and fundamentally compromises tissue formation (i.e., histogenesis). Emerging research suggests that ethanol can impair mammalian development by interfering with the execution of molecular programs governing differentiation. For example, ethanol exposure disrupts cellular migration, changes cell cell interactions, and alters growth factor signaling pathways. Additionally, ethanol can alter epigenetic mechanisms controlling gene expression. Normally, lineage-specific regulatory factors (i.e., transcription factors) establish the transcriptional networks of each new cell type; the cell's identity then is maintained through epigenetic alterations in the way in which the DNA encoding each gene becomes packaged within the chromatin. Ethanol exposure can induce epigenetic changes that do not induce genetic mutations but nonetheless alter the course of fetal development and result in a large array of patterning defects. Two crucial enzyme complexes-the Polycomb and Trithorax proteins are central to the epigenetic programs controlling the intricate balance between self-renewal and the execution of cellular differentiation, with diametrically opposed functions. Prenatal ethanol exposure may disrupt the functions of these two enzyme complexes, altering a crucial aspect of mammalian differentiation.

W.","BACKGROUND: Fish are important sources of protein and contain a variety of nutrients, such as n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), essential for normal brain development. Nevertheless, all fish also contain methyl mercury (MeHg), a known neurotoxicant in adequate dosage. Our studies of the Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS) Main Cohort enrolled in 1989-1990 (n=779) have found no consistent pattern of adverse MeHg effects at exposures achieved by daily fish consumption. Rather, we have observed evidence of improved performance on some cognitive endpoints as prenatal MeHg exposure increases in the range studied. These observations cannot be related to MeHg and may reflect the role of unmeasured covariates such as essential nutrients present in fish. To determine if these associations persist into young adulthood, we examined the relationship between prenatal MeHg exposure, recent PUFA exposure and subjects' neurodevelopment and behavior at 19 years of age.
METHODS: We examined 533 participants using the following test battery: the Profile of Mood States-Bipolar (POMS-Bi); Finger Tapping; Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (K-BIT); measures of Fine Motor Control and Complex Perceptual Motor Control; and Visual Spatial Contrast Sensitivity. We collected the following covariates: maternal IQ, family life course stressors, socioeconomic status, and subjects' recent postnatal MeHg, sex, and computer use. Primary analyses (based on N=392-475) examined covariate-adjusted associations in multiple linear regression models with prenatal MeHg as the primary exposure measure. Secondary analyses additionally adjusted for total n-6 and fish-related n-3 PUFA measured in the subjects' serum at the 19-year examination.
RESULTS: Study participants had a mean prenatal MeHg exposure of 6.9 ppm, and a mean recent postnatal exposure of 10.3 ppm. There were no adverse associations between prenatal MeHg and any of the measured endpoints. For recent postnatal MeHg exposure, however, adverse associations were observed for Finger Tapping (non-dominant hand) among women and for the K-BIT Matrices for both sexes, with or without adjustment for PUFA.
CONCLUSION: Our findings continue to provide no evidence for an adverse effect of prenatal MeHg exposure on development in a cohort that consumes fish daily. Observations for postnatal MeHg exposure will need to be confirmed using more comprehensive exposure measures.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

M.","The GABAergic neurotransmission is a highly conserved system that has been attributed to various regulatory events. There has been a notable number of studies on the importance of GABAergic neurotransmission, both excitatory and inhibitory, in neurogenesis and central nervous system development including its control of neuronal cell proliferation and migration, synaptogenesis, dendrite formation and branching, and new neuronal cell integration in the adult brain. There has been remarkable progress in understanding the epigenetic regulations of GABAergic genes and their aberrant expressions in various neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, Rett's syndrome, schizophrenia and PWS. The roles of histone modifications, chromatin looping and gene methylation have been implicated in altered regulations of key genes in the GABAergic pathway. Taken together, they affect the functioning of GABAergic neurotransmission and disrupt various events in brain development. Here, we focus on the role of GABAergic neurotransmission in brain development and on how various genetic and epigenetic events regulate the GABAergic genes in pre- and postnatal brain. We also discuss how these regulatory mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of neurological disorders and, therefore, can be used in the development of potential epigenetic therapy for these diseases.

S.","Autism remains an idiopathic disorder in 90% of cases. Recent prevalence, heritability, and genetic studies are suggestive that epigenetic and, therefore, environmental factors are important in autism pathogenesis. Among the environmental factors, only some uncommon viral infections and certain drugs have been conclusively linked to autism causation. Thalidomide, valproate, terbutaline and, most recently, antidepressants are the main drugs reported to elevate autism risk. This article discusses a phenomenal relationship between the drugs reported to elevate autism risk and the antiproliferative effects of the same drugs and/or analogs of the drugs in cancer cells. Cancer treatment has entered a new era-epigenetic therapy. In cancer cell lines, thalidomide is antiangiogenic and antiproliferative via suppression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and downstream effects on the nuclear factor (NFkappaB) cascade. Valproate shares similar mechanisms with thalidomide, but is best known in cancer therapy for its epigenetic effects as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Terbutaline, a beta-adrenergic agonist, acts via adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-PKA signal transduction. Current cancer therapy aims to exploit this epigenetic pathway by developing site-selective cAMP analogs. Last, it has long been noted in preclinical studies that some antidepressants are antiproliferative in cancer cells but the mechanisms remain unclear. Based on a systematic review of these drugs, it is hypothesized that all central nervous system-acting drugs, which show antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines, share the potential to elevate autism risk when administered prenatally. It is further posited that, in autism, the drugs act as ""triggers"" that disturb the pro-proliferative fetal milieu using the same, mainly epigenetic, mechanisms that they demonstrate in rapidly proliferating cancer cells. In addition to their direct antiproliferative effects, evidence is suggestive that the drugs may lock in the pro-inflammatory bias of the prenatal immune system by preventing normal perinatal dendritic cell maturation. This unifying hypothesis for how structurally different drugs elevate autism risk could help focus research on other drugs, or other xenobiotics, that may elevate autism risk. For example, there is evidence that an old class of drugs, the phenothiazines, is antiproliferative in cancer cell lines via inhibition of calmodulin and/or histaminic pathways. Promethazine, one of the first heterocyclic phenothiazines synthesized, is commonly prescribed during pregnancy; however, its role in elevating the risk of autism has not been investigated. Based on the anti-proliferation hypothesis, more studies of promethazine and other similar drugs are suggested to evaluate their potential to elevate autism risk following prenatal exposures.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

E.","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a leading cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Some affected individuals possess distinctive craniofacial deficits, but many more lack overt facial changes. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying these deficits would inform their diagnostic utility. Our understanding of these mechanisms is challenged because ethanol lacks a single receptor when redirecting cellular activity. This review summarizes our current understanding of how ethanol alters neural crest development. Ample evidence shows that ethanol causes the ""classic"" fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) face (short palpebral fissures, elongated upper lip, deficient philtrum) because it suppresses prechordal plate outgrowth, thereby reducing neuroectoderm and neural crest induction and causing holoprosencephaly. Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) at premigratory stages elicits a different facial appearance, indicating FASD may represent a spectrum of facial outcomes. PAE at this premigratory period initiates a calcium transient that activates CaMKII and destabilizes transcriptionally active beta-catenin, thereby initiating apoptosis within neural crest populations. Contributing to neural crest vulnerability are their low antioxidant responses. Ethanol-treated neural crest produce reactive oxygen species and free radical scavengers attenuate their production and prevent apoptosis. Ethanol also significantly impairs neural crest migration, causing cytoskeletal rearrangements that destabilize focal adhesion formation; their directional migratory capacity is also lost. Genetic factors further modify vulnerability to ethanol-induced craniofacial dysmorphology and include genes important for neural crest development, including shh signaling, PDFGA, vangl2, and ribosomal biogenesis. Because facial and brain development are mechanistically and functionally linked, research into ethanol's effects on neural crest also informs our understanding of ethanol's CNS pathologies.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

The goal of the present study was to examine, in a large cohort of children with FASD, prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but not FASD, and typically developing control children, the relationship between performance in eye movement tasks and standardized psychometric tests that assess visuospatial processing and working memory. Participants for this dataset were drawn from a large, multi-site investigation, and included children and adolescents aged 5-17 years diagnosed with an FASD (n=71), those with PAE but no clinical FASD diagnosis (n=20), and typically developing controls (n=111). Participants completed a neurobehavioral test battery and a series of saccadic eye movement tasks. The FASD group performed worse than controls on the psychometric and eye movement measures of working memory and visuospatial skills. Within the FASD group, digit recall, block recall, and animal sorting were negatively correlated with sequence errors on the memory-guided task, and arrows was negatively correlated with prosaccade endpoint error. There were no significant correlations in the control group. These data suggest that psychometric tests and eye movement control tasks may assess similar domains of cognitive function, and these assessment tools may be measuring overlapping brain regions damaged due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The results of this study demonstrate that eye movement control tasks directly relate to outcome measures obtained with psychometric tests and are able to assess multiple domains of cognition simultaneously, thereby allowing for an efficient and accurate assessment.",,0,WP2,WP3,0

C.; Sen, A.; Cingolani, P.; Shaik, A.; Land, S. J.; Ruden, D. M.","Exposure to lead (Pb) during childhood can result in learning disabilities and behavioral problems. Although described in animal models, whether Pb exposure also alters neuronal differentiation in the developing brains of exposed children is unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of physiologically relevant concentrations of Pb (from 0.4 to 1.9muM) on the capacity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to progress to a neuronal fate. We found that neither acute nor chronic exposure to Pb prevented hESCs from generating neural progenitor cells (NPCs). NPCs derived from hESCs chronically exposed to 1.9muM Pb throughout the neural differentiation process generated 2.5 times more TUJ1-positive neurons than those derived from control hESCs. Pb exposure of hESCs during the stage of neural rosette formation resulted in a significant decrease in the expression levels of the neural marker genes PAX6 and MSI1. Furthermore, the resulting NPCs differentiated into neurons with shorter neurites and less branching than control neurons, as assessed by Sholl analysis. DNA methylation studies of control, acutely treated hESCs and NPCs derived from chronically exposed hESCs using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip demonstrated that Pb exposure induced changes in the methylation status of genes involved in neurogenetic signaling pathways. In summary, our study shows that exposure to Pb subtly alters the neuronal differentiation of exposed hESCs and that these changes could be partly mediated by modifications in the DNA methylation status of genes crucial to brain development.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

The neural stem cell line HUCB-NSC has been previously shown to be susceptible to MeHgCl in developmentally dependent manner. Here we demonstrated that developmental sensitivity of HUCB-NSC to MeHgCl depends upon the type of adhesive biomolecules and the geometry of biodomains. Proliferation of HUCB-NSC was diminished in time and MeHgCl concentration dependent manner. In addition, the response to MeHgCl was found to be cell-type dependent. Undifferentiated cells were the most sensitive independently of the type of bioactive domain. Significant decrease of GFAP+ cells was detected among cells growing on poly-L-lysine, while on fibronectin and vitronectin, this effect was observed only in the highest (1 mu M) concentration of MeHgCl. beta-Tubulin III expressing cells were most sensitive on fibronectin domains. In addition, limited bioactive domains to mu m in size, as compared to non-patterned larger area of the same adhesive substrate, exerted protective role.

However, alcohol dose/occasion during pregnancywas inversely related to cortical thickness in 3 regions-right cuneus/pericalcarine/superior parietal lobe, fusiform/lingual gyrus, and supramarginal/ postcentral gyrus. The effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on IQwas mediated by cortical thickness in the right occipitotemporal region. It is noteworthy that a continuous measure ofmaternal alcohol consumption during pregnancywas more sensitive than FASD diagnosis and that the effect on cortical thickness was most evident in relation to a measure of maternal binge drinking.

The majority of studies, and especially several recent epidemiological studies, observed a higher likelihood for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD symptoms in exposed subjects. However, both human and animal studies have failed to provide clear evidence on causality. Existing literature on studies investigating the association between prenatal nicotine exposure and conduct or externalising problems in the offspring suggests a causal effect. The establishment of a final conclusion concerning the relationship between prenatal nicotine exposure and internalising problems in the offspring is complicated by insufficient data and mixed results in epidemiological studies. Prenatal nicotine exposure has been associated with altered brain structure and function in human offspring, and a proposed biological mechanism is related to nicotine's adverse influence on neurotransmitter systems during brain development. In conclusion, establishing a statement on the causality of the relationship between prenatal nicotine exposure and behavioural problems in children remains a challenging task.

J.","Many studies investigating cognitive outcomes in children of women with epilepsy report an increased risk of mental impairment. Verbal scores on neuropsychometric measures may be selectively more involved. While a variety of factors contribute to the cognitive problems of children of women with epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) appear to play a major role. The mechanisms by which AEDs affect neurodevelopmental outcomes remain poorly defined. Animal models suggest that AED-induced apoptosis, altered neurotransmitter environment, and impaired synaptogenesis are some of the mechanisms responsible for cognitive and behavioral teratogenesis. AEDs that are known to induce apoptosis, such as valproate, appear to affect children's neurodevelopment in a more severe fashion. Fetal valproate exposure has dose-dependent associations with reduced cognitive abilities across a range of domains, and these appear to persist at least until the age of 6. Some studies have shown neurodevelopmental deficiencies associated with the use of phenobarbital and possibly phenytoin. So far, most of the investigations available suggest that fetal exposures to lamotrigine or levetiracetam are safer with regard to cognition when compared with other AEDs. Studies on carbamazepine show contradictory results, but most information available suggests that major poor cognitive outcomes should not be attributed to this medication. Overall, children exposed to polytherapy prenatally appear to have worse cognitive and behavioral outcomes compared with children exposed to monotherapy, and with the unexposed.

J.; Lampa, J.; Le Maitre, E.","BACKGROUND: The cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) primarily functions through acetylcholine (ACh)-alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) interaction on macrophages to control peripheral inflammation. Interestingly, ACh can also bind alpha7nAChRs on microglia resulting in neuroprotective effects. However, ACh effects on astrocytes remain elusive. Here, we investigated the effects of nicotine, an ACh receptor agonist, on the cytokine and cholinesterase production of immunocompetent human astrocytes stimulated with interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) in vitro. In addition, the potential involvement of prostaglandins as mediators of nicotine was studied using cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibition.
METHODS: Cultured human fetal astrocytes were stimulated with human recombinant IL-1beta and treated simultaneously with nicotine at different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 muM). Cell supernatants were collected for cytokine and cholinesterase profiling using ELISA and MesoScale multiplex assay. alpha7nAChR expression on activated human astrocytes was studied using immunofluorescence. For the COX-2 inhibition studies, enzyme activity was inhibited using NS-398. One-way ANOVA was used to perform statistical analyses.
RESULTS: Nicotine treatment dose dependently limits the production of critical proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 (60.5 +/- 3.3, %inhibition), IL-1beta (42.4 +/- 1.7, %inhibition), and TNF-alpha (68.9 +/- 7.7, %inhibition) by activated human astrocytes. Interestingly, it also inhibits IL-8 chemokine (31.4 +/- 8.5, %inhibition), IL-13 (34.243 +/- 4.9, %inhibition), and butyrylcholinesterase (20.8 +/- 2.8, %inhibition) production at 100 muM. Expression of alpha7nAChR was detected on the activated human astrocytes. Importantly, nicotine's inhibitory effect on IL-6 production was reversed with the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398.
CONCLUSIONS: Activation of the cholinergic system through alpha7nAChR agonists has been known to suppress inflammation both in the CNS and periphery. In the CNS, earlier experimental data shows that cholinergic activation through nicotine inhibits microglial activation and proinflammatory cytokine release. Here, we report similar anti-inflammatory effects of cholinergic activation on human astrocytes, at least partly mediated through the COX-2 pathway. These results confirm the potential for cholinergic neuroprotection, which is looked upon as a promising therapy for neuroinflammation as well as neurodegenerative diseases and stroke.

Alcohol -induced abnormalities in glial cells have been suspected of contributing to the adverse effects of alcohol on the developing brain for several years, although much research still needs to be done to causally link the effects of alcohol on specific brain structures and behavior to alterations in glial cell development and function. Damage to radial glia due to prenatal alcohol exposure may underlie observations of abnormal neuronal and glial migration in humans with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), as well as primate and rodent models of FAS. A reduction in cell number and altered development has been reported for several glial cell types in animal models of FAS. In utero alcohol exposure can cause microencephaly when alcohol exposure occurs during the brain growth spurt a period characterized by rapid astrocyte proliferation and maturation; since astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the brain, microenchephaly may be caused by reduced astrocyte proliferation or survival, as observed in in vitro and in vivo studies. Delayed oligodendrocyte development and increased oligodendrocyte precursor apoptosis has also been reported in experimental models of FASD, which may be linked to altered myelination/white matter integrity found in FASO children. Children with FAS exhibit hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, two areas requiring guidance from glial cells and proper maturation of oligodendrocytes. Finally, developmental alcohol exposure disrupts microglial function and induces microglial apoptosis; given the role of microglia in synaptic pruning during brain development, the effects of alcohol on microglia may be involved in the abnormal brain plasticity reported in FASD. The consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure on glial cells, including radial glia and other transient glial structures present in the developing brain, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and their precursors, and microglia contributes to abnormal neuronal development, reduced neuron survival and disrupted brain architecture and connectivity. This review highlights the CNS structural abnormalities caused by in utero alcohol exposure and outlines which abnormalities are likely mediated by alcohol effects on glial cell development and function.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

A.; Kim, H. Y.","Previous studies demonstrated that prenatal exposure to ethanol interferes with embryonic and fetal development, and causes abnormal neurodevelopment. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid highly enriched in the brain, was shown to be essential for proper brain development and function. Recently, we found that N-docosahexenoyethanolamine (synaptamide), an endogenous metabolite of DHA, is a potent PKA-dependent neurogenic factor for neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation. In this study, we demonstrate that ethanol at pharmacologically relevant concentrations downregulates cAMP signaling in NSC and impairs neurogenic differentiation. In contrast, synaptamide reverses ethanol-impaired NSC neurogenic differentiation through counter-acting on the cAMP production system. NSC exposure to ethanol (25-50 mM) for 4 days dose-dependently decreased the number of Tuj-1 positive neurons and PKA/CREB phosphorylation with a concomitant reduction of cellular cAMP. Ethanol-induced cAMP reduction was accompanied by the inhibition of G-protein activation and expression of adenylyl cyclase (AC) 7 and AC8, as well as PDE4 upregulation. In contrast to ethanol, synaptamide increased cAMP production, GTPgammaS binding, and expression of AC7 and AC8 isoforms in a cAMP-dependent manner, offsetting the ethanol-induced impairment in neurogenic differentiation. These results indicate that synaptamide can reduce ethanol-induced impairment of neuronal differentiation by counter-affecting shared targets in G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)/cAMP signaling. The synaptamide-mediated mechanism observed in this study may offer a possible avenue for ameliorating the adverse impact of fetal alcohol exposure on neurodevelopment.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

E.","Although the involvement of genetic abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is well-accepted, recent studies point to an equal contribution by environmental factors, particularly environmental toxicants. However, these toxicant-related studies in ASD have not been systematically reviewed to date. Therefore, we compiled publications investigating potential associations between environmental toxicants and ASD and arranged these publications into the following three categories: (a) studies examining estimated toxicant exposures in the environment during the preconceptional, gestational and early childhood periods; (b) studies investigating biomarkers of toxicants; and (c) studies examining potential genetic susceptibilities to toxicants. A literature search of nine electronic scientific databases through November 2013 was performed. In the first category examining ASD risk and estimated toxicant exposures in the environment, the majority of studies (34/37; 92%) reported an association. Most of these studies were retrospective case-control, ecological or prospective cohort studies, although a few had weaker study designs (for example, case reports or series). Toxicants implicated in ASD included pesticides, phthalates, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), solvents, toxic waste sites, air pollutants and heavy metals, with the strongest evidence found for air pollutants and pesticides. Gestational exposure to methylmercury (through fish exposure, one study) and childhood exposure to pollutants in water supplies (two studies) were not found to be associated with ASD risk. In the second category of studies investigating biomarkers of toxicants and ASD, a large number was dedicated to examining heavy metals. Such studies demonstrated mixed findings, with only 19 of 40 (47%) case-control studies reporting higher concentrations of heavy metals in blood, urine, hair, brain or teeth of children with ASD compared with controls. Other biomarker studies reported that solvent, phthalate and pesticide levels were associated with ASD, whereas PCB studies were mixed. Seven studies reported a relationship between autism severity and heavy metal biomarkers, suggesting evidence of a dose-effect relationship. Overall, the evidence linking biomarkers of toxicants with ASD (the second category) was weaker compared with the evidence associating estimated exposures to toxicants in the environment and ASD risk (the first category) because many of the biomarker studies contained small sample sizes and the relationships between biomarkers and ASD were inconsistent across studies. Regarding the third category of studies investigating potential genetic susceptibilities to toxicants, 10 unique studies examined polymorphisms in genes associated with increased susceptibilities to toxicants, with 8 studies reporting that such polymorphisms were more common in ASD individuals (or their mothers, 1 study) compared with controls (one study examined multiple polymorphisms). Genes implicated in these studies included paraoxonase (PON1, three of five studies), glutathione S-transferase (GSTM1 and GSTP1, three of four studies), delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (one study), SLC11A3 (one study) and the metal regulatory transcription factor 1 (one of two studies). Notably, many of the reviewed studies had significant limitations, including lack of replication, limited sample sizes, retrospective design, recall and publication biases, inadequate matching of cases and controls, and the use of nonstandard tools to diagnose ASD. The findings of this review suggest that the etiology of ASD may involve, at least in a subset of children, complex interactions between genetic factors and certain environmental toxicants that may act synergistically or in parallel during critical periods of neurodevelopment, in a manner that increases the likelihood of developing ASD. Because of the limitations of many of the reviewed studies, additional high-quality epidemiological studies concerning environmental toxicants and ASD are warranted to confirm and clarify many of t",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

The median concentrations of cord serum Mn and Se were 4.0 microg/L and 63.1 microg/L, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the interaction between Se and Mn was observed. Cord blood Mn levels had different effects on NBNA scores stratified by different cord blood Se levels. With Se<P50 (<63.1 microg/L), Mn was negatively associated with NBNA scores (adjusted s = -1.1, 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.9, p<0.001) and a higher cord blood Mn level increased the risk of low NBNA (adjusted OR = 5.7, 95% CI: 2.8 to 11.5, p<0.001).

We aimed to characterize the neural correlates of PCE based on functional connectivity measurements of the amygdala and insula at the earliest stage of development. Our results revealed common drug exposure-related connectivity disruptions within the amygdala-frontal, insula-frontal, and insula-sensorimotor circuits.

Methods: We open with a discussion of children's vulnerability to neurotoxic substances, changes in the distribution of toxic exposures, and cooccurrence of social and physical exposures. We address trends in prevalence of mental health disorders, and approaches to the definition of disorders that are sensitive to the subtle effects of toxic exposures. We suggest broadening outcomes to include dimensional measures of autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and child learning capacity, as well as direct assessment of brain function. Findings: We consider the impact of two important exposures on children's mental health: lead and pesticides. We argue that longitudinal research designs may capture the cascading effects of exposures across biological systems and the full-range of neuropsychological endpoints. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool for observing brain maturation under varying environmental conditions. A dimensional approach to measurement may be sensitive to subtle subclinical toxic effects, permitting the development of exposure-related profiles and testing of complex functional relationships between brain and behavior.

J.; Harper, K. M.; Graf, E. N.; Redei, E. E.","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) presents a collection of symptoms representing physiological and behavioral phenotypes caused by maternal alcohol consumption. Symptom severity is modified by genetic differences in fetal susceptibility and resistance as well as maternal genetic factors such as maternal alcohol sensitivity. Animal models demonstrate that both maternal and paternal genetics contribute to the variation in the fetus' vulnerability to alcohol exposure. Maternal and paternal genetics define the variations in these phenotypes even without the effect of alcohol in utero, as most of these traits are polygenic, non-Mendelian, in their inheritance. In addition, the epigenetic alterations that instigate the alcohol induced neurodevelopmental deficits can interact with the polygenic inheritance of respective traits. Here, based on specific examples, we present the hypothesis that the principles of non-Mendelian inheritance, or ""exceptions"" to Mendelian genetics, can be the driving force behind the severity of the prenatal alcohol-exposed individual's symptomology. One such exception is when maternal alleles lead to an altered intrauterine hormonal environment and, therefore, produce variations in the long-term consequences on the development of the alcohol-exposed fetus. Another exception is when epigenetic regulation of allele-specific gene expression generates disequilibrium between the maternal vs. paternal genetic contributions, and thereby, modifies the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure on the fetus. We propose that these situations in which one parent has an exaggerated influence over the offspring's vulnerability to prenatal alcohol are major contributing mechanisms responsible for the variations in the symptomology of FASD in the exposed generation and beyond. © 2014 Tunc-Ozcan, Sittig, Harper, Graf and Redei.",,WP1,0,WP3,0

Also we discuss the brain health effects associated from exposure to EEDs including the promotion of neurodegeneration, protection against neurodegeneration, and involvement in various neurological deficits; changes in rearing behavior, locomotion, anxiety, learning difficulties, memory issues, and neuronal abnormalities. The effects of EEDs on the brain are varied during the entire life span and far-reaching with many different mechanisms. To understand endocrine disrupting chemicals mechanisms, we use bioinformatics, molecular, and epidemiologic approaches. Through those approaches, we learn how the effects of EEDs on the brain go beyond known mechanism to disrupt the circulatory and neural estrogen function and estrogen-mediated signaling.

Bioinformatics analysis of gene-EEDs interactions and brain disease associations identified hundreds of genes that were altered by exposure to estrogen, phthalate, PCBs, BPA or metalloestrogens. Many genes modified by EEDs are common targets of both 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and NRF1. Some of these genes are involved with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Brain Neoplasms. For example, the search of enriched pathways showed that top ten E2 interacting genes in AD-APOE, APP, ATP5A1, CALM1, CASP3, GSK3B, IL1B, MAPT, PSEN2 and TNF-underlie the enrichment of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) AD pathway. With AD, the six E2-responsive genes are NRF1 target genes: APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1. These genes are also responsive to the following EEDs: ethinyl estradiol (APBB2, DPYSL2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), BPA (APBB2, EIF2S1, ENO1, MAPT, and PAXIP1), dibutyl phthalate (DPYSL2, EIF2S1, and ENO1), diethylhexyl phthalate (DPYSL2 and MAPT). To validate findings from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) curated data, we used Bayesian network (BN) analysis on microarray data of AD patients. We observed that both gender and NRF1 were associated with AD. The female NRF1 gene network is completely different from male human AD patients. AD-associated NRF1 target genes-APLP1, APP, GRIN1, GRIN2B, MAPT, PSEN2, PEN2, and IDE-are also regulated by E2. NRF1 regulates targets genes with diverse functions, including cell growth, apoptosis/autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, genomic instability, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, synaptogenesis, and senescence. By activating or repressing the genes involved in cell proliferation, growth suppression, DNA damage/repair, apoptosis/autophagy, angiogenesis, estrogen signaling, neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, and senescence, and inducing a wide range of DNA damage, genomic instability and DNA methylation and transcriptional repression, NRF1 may act as a major regulator of EEDs-induced brain health deficits. In summary, estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals-modified genes in brain health deficits are part of both estrogen and NRF1 signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that in addition to estrogen signaling, EEDs influencing NRF1 regulated communities of genes ac",,WP1,0,WP3,0

N.","Heavy prenatal alcohol exposure results in a range of deficits, including both volumetric and functional changes in brain regions involved in response inhibition such as the prefrontal cortex and striatum. The current study examined blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response during a stop signal task in adolescents (ages 13-16 y) with histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE, n = 21) and controls (CON, n = 21). Task performance was measured using percent correct inhibits during three difficulty conditions: easy, medium, and hard. Group differences in BOLD response relative to baseline motor responding were examined across all inhibition trials and for each difficulty condition separately. The contrast between hard and easy trials was analyzed to determine whether increasing task difficulty affected BOLD response. Groups had similar task performance and demographic characteristics, except for full scale IQ scores (AE < CON). The AE group demonstrated greater BOLD response in frontal, sensorimotor, striatal, and cingulate regions relative to controls, especially as task difficulty increased. When contrasting hard vs. easy inhibition trials, the AE group showed greater medial/superior frontal and cuneus BOLD response than controls. Results were unchanged after demographics and FAS diagnosis were statistically controlled. This was the first fMRI study to utilize a stop signal task, isolating fronto-striatal functioning, to assess response inhibition and the effects task difficulty in adolescents with prenatal alcohol exposure. Results suggest that heavy prenatal alcohol exposure disrupts neural function of this circuitry, resulting in immature cognitive processing and motor-association learning and neural compensation during response inhibition.

J.; Carnahan, M. N.; Muller, D.; Miranda, R. C.; Golding, M. C.","BACKGROUND: From studies using a diverse range of model organisms, we now acknowledge that epigenetic changes to chromatin structure provide a plausible link between environmental teratogens and alterations in gene expression leading to disease. Observations from a number of independent laboratories indicate that ethanol (EtOH) has the capacity to act as a powerful epigenetic disruptor and potentially derail the coordinated processes of cellular differentiation. In this study, we sought to examine whether primary neurospheres cultured under conditions maintaining stemness were susceptible to alcohol-induced alterations in the histone code. We focused our studies on trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 and trimethylated histone 3 lysine 27, as these are 2 of the most prominent posttranslational histone modifications regulating stem cell maintenance and neural differentiation.
METHODS: Primary neurosphere cultures were maintained under conditions promoting the stem cell state and treated with EtOH for 5 days. Control and EtOH-treated cellular extracts were examined using a combination of quantitative RT-PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation techniques.
RESULTS: We find that the regulatory regions of genes controlling both neural precursor cell identity and processes of differentiation exhibited significant declines in the enrichment of the chromatin marks examined. Despite these widespread changes in chromatin structure, only a small subset of genes including Dlx2, Fabp7, Nestin, Olig2, and Pax6 displayed EtOH-induced alterations in transcription. Unexpectedly, the majority of chromatin-modifying enzymes examined including members of the Polycomb Repressive Complex displayed minimal changes in expression and localization. Only transcripts encoding Dnmt1, Uhrf1, Ehmt1, Ash2 l, Wdr5, and Kdm1b exhibited significant differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that primary neurospheres maintained as stem cells in vitro are susceptible to alcohol-induced perturbation of the histone code and errors in the epigenetic program. These observations indicate that alterations to chromatin structure may represent a crucial component of alcohol teratogenesis and progress toward a better understanding of the developmental origins of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",,WP1,WP2,WP3,0

Methods Two hundred eighteen CE and 197 nonexposed infants were enrolled at birth and followed through mid-adolescence. Birth CE status was determined by interview and biologic measures. Multiple demographic, drug, and environmental correlates were controlled. Standardized, normative, reliable measures of fetal growth, intelligence quotient (IQ), behavior, executive function, and language were given at each age and risk for substance misuse assessed in adolescence. A subset of children received volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 years and functional MRI at 14 years. The effect of CE was determined through multiple regression analyses controlling for confounders. Results Cocaine exposed had significant negative effects on fetal growth, attention, executive function, language, and behavior, while overall IQ was not affected. CE had significant negative effects on perceptual reasoning IQ and visual-motor skills and predicted lower volume of corpus callosum and decreased gray matter in the occipital and parietal lobes. CE children had higher risk for substance misuse. Confounding risk factors had additive effects on developmental outcomes. Conclusions Prenatal exposure to cocaine was related to poorer perceptual organization IQ, visual-spatial information processing, attention, language, executive function, and behavior regulation through early adolescence.

Ethanol (EtOH) adversely affected both SCs proliferation and myelin formation in culture. Resveratrol (Res) has been shown to regulate many cellular processes and to display multiple protective and therapeutic effects. Whether Res has protective effects on SCs with EtOH-induced toxicity is still unclear. The protective efficacy of Res on EtOH-treated SCs in vitro was investigated in the present study. Res improved cell viability of the EtOH-treated SCs. Hoechst 33342 staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling analysis showed that the EtOH-induced apoptosis was inhibited by Res. The effects of Res were blocked by the 50-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase inhibitor Compound C and the silencing information regulator T1 inhibitor nicotinamide. Res could increase the mRNA and protein levels of BDNF and GDNF in the EtOH-treated SCs. However, the EtOH-induced increase of NGF in the SCs is inhibited by Res.

C.; Sheng, W. S.; Ni, H. T.; Lokensgard, J. R.; Peterson, P. K.","Maternal use of cocaine during pregnancy is associated with sustained morphological brain abnormalities and sustained cognitive deficits in the offspring. Here, we use a cell culture model of highly enriched human fetal brain-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs) to assess the effects of cocaine treatment on their proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Our data show that cocaine treatment markedly inhibited the proliferation of NPCs, a phenomenon that was associated with cell cycle arrest, possibly because of increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. In addition, treatment of NPCs with cocaine inhibited their migratory response to CXCL12 (stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha), a finding that correlated with cocaine-induced down-regulation of CXCR4 on NPCs. Finally, these data demonstrated that NPCs exposed to cocaine underwent differentiation into cells expressing neuronal markers that was associated with an inhibition of SOX2 (SRY-related HMG-box gene 2), a transcription factor that inhibits NPC differentiation. Taken together, these results point to several cellular mechanisms whereby exposure of human neural stem cells to cocaine in utero could contribute to subsequent neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive deficits.",,WP1,0,WP3,0
