To use rsr you can call functions with a provided `token` or set the `SYSREV_TOKEN` environmental variable. You can find your token by clicking your profile link on sysrev.com and going to settings. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/")
```

To run a function with 
```{r setup}
a = rsr::get_articles(3144,"your project token")
```
